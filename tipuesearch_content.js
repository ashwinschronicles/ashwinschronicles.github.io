To determine if rolling time is dependant of surface friction. System description Consider the inclined plane in figure 1 . let's establish all the forces acting on this rolling body . The force mg is acting in the downward direction and it has two components one is parallel to the plank and there's one component which is perpendicular to the plank and this in turn causes normal reaction and we call it \\(F_{n}\\) . We also have a force of friction which is acting opposite to the direction of roll. we are considering a situation where the body is not slipping down the ramp it is smoothly rolling down the lamp so force of friction which is static in nature is more than \\(mg\\sin\\theta\\) and it is not necessary that \\(f_{s}\\) here is \\(f_{s}max\\) , so the moment \\(mg\\sin\\theta\\) exceeds \\(f_{s}max\\) the body will start slipping (i.e for smooth rolling \\(f_{s}>mg\\sin\\theta\\) ) Lets write the equations of motion of this rolling body, first we'll write the forces acting on the body considering its linear motion we can say $$f_{s}-mg\\sin\\theta=ma_{x}$$ We now notice that only \\(F_{s}\\) can produce torque to the body as all other forces are going right through the axis of rotation of the cylinder and therefore its distance from the axis of rotation of the cylinder is zero . $$\\tau=I\\alpha$$ $$f_{s}R=I\\alpha$$ $$a_{x}=R\\alpha$$ $$f_{s}=Ia_{x}/R&#94;{2}$$ $$Ia_{x}/R&#94;{2}-mg\\sin\\theta=ma_{x}$$ $$a_{x}=\\frac{g\\sin\\theta}{1+I/mR&#94;{2}}$$ The time taken for the cylinder to cover a distance S (along the inclination) can be calculated from $$t=\\sqrt{(\\frac{2S}{a_{x}})}$$ $$t=\\sqrt{\\frac{2S(1+I/mR&#94;{2})}{g\\sin\\theta}}\\label{eq:time}$$ In the limiting case where frictional force can no longer support rolling of the cylinder, thus the cylinder begins to slip. Analysing this case, \\(f_{s}=\\mu N=\\mu mg\\cos\\theta\\) thus $$\\mu mg\\cos\\theta_{max}=Ia_{x}/R&#94;{2}$$ $$\\mu mg\\cos\\theta_{max}=\\frac{Ig\\sin\\theta_{max}}{R&#94;{2}+I/m}$$ $$\\mu=\\frac{I\\tan\\theta_{max}}{mR&#94;{2}+I}\\label{eq:mu}$$ Experimental Method Measure the dimensions such as lengths and radii of the Belan and record them with percentage errors using the accuracy involved with measuring tools Measure the bench parameters in a similar way. Calculate lift parameters ( vertical lift required for each degree). Lift one end the bench using a Car Jack along with some wooden planks (ensuring the balance of the bench isn't disturbed). Plot t versus sin \\(\\theta\\) other quantities like t2, 1/t, 1/t2 etc. and try to get a linear plot. find the moment of inertia of belan. To determine if rolling time is dependant of surface friction. Try find coefficient of friction. Try to replace the surface and determine if rolling time is dependant of surface. Observations & Measurements Measurement of linear distances Measurement of radii of belan In order to measure the radii of the belan, a thread was used cover the circumference and a marking is done with a pen on both of the strings at the same level as shown in Fig 2 and then the thread is placed on a ruler and the distance between the two markings on the string is measured, as shown in Fig 3 . The least count of scale is 0.05 cm for the smaller radius and 0.1cm for bigger radius. Circumference of the smaller radius (in cm) Circumference of the bigger radius (in cm) Trial 1 4.5 11 Trial 2 4.6 11.2 Trial 3 4.6 11.2 Mean value 4.56 11.13 Measured circumference data Thus the nominal values of radii are 0.73 cm and 1.77 cm (round to two decimal places) respectively. we know that \\(c=2\\pi r\\) so, \\(\\Delta r=r\\Delta c/c\\) so the error in measurement of radius is 0.008 cm and 0.016 cm respectively. Therefore \\(R_{1}=0.73\\pm0.01\\) cm and \\(R_{2}=1.77\\pm0.02\\) cm (two significant figures). Measurement of length of belan In order to measure the length of the belan, I placed the belan against a wall and the height was recorded on top of a painters tape (Fig 6 ), next we use a tape measure to measure the distance from ground to this marking (Fig 7 ). The length of belan as measured using this procedure is 35.8 \\(\\pm\\) 0.1 cm (least count of tape measure is 0.1 cm) Measurement of distance travelled by belan The bench used for the experiment has total length as 172cm (fig 8 ). However the belan can travel only part of the distance. On either side, the shape of the belan prevents it from starting at the very end (and reaching the lowest point) thus a tape has been put to keep track of the start and the end point of the belan. As seen from the Figure 10 & 9 , the total length the belan can traverse is (166 - 4.3) = 161.7 cm. The least count of the scale used here is 1mm. Therefore the total length the belan can traverse is 161.7 \\(\\pm\\) 0.1 cm. Measurement of vertical lift at one end The selected bench for measurement has maximum flat length as 172 cm. We want to perform experiment at angles from 2 degree to 16 degree at an interval of 2. We can calculate the height required to be lifted at one end to reach the given set of angles as \\(L=172\\sin\\theta\\) . This gives us the following table 1 . Angle(degree) lift required (cm) lift rounded to LC of scale (cm) 2 6.003 6 4 11.998 12 6 17.979 18 8 23.938 24 10 29.867 30 12 35.761 35.8 14 41.611 41.6 16 47.410 47.4 . The Car Jack has been placed at the middle of one end of the bench (Fig 12 ). For larger lengths (20cm onward) a set of wooden planks are added to increase the height (Fig 13 ). The bench can be lifted higher by rotating the shaft of the car jack until the required height is met (Fig ). Since the height can be measured to 0.1cm accuracy ( LC of the scale used) this also translates into the accuracy for angle of the inclined plane. While measuring height care must be taken that the scale is perpendicular to ground and the height of the center of the bench leg is measured. One can use a flat card as a pointer and to avoid parallax. (Fig 11 ) Measurement of time taken to roll down In order to measure the time taken for the belan to roll down, video of the experiment was taken in a mobile phone. The video recorded was then processed frame by frame to find the number of frames between the starting and belan reaching the end. This analysis was done on a mobile app named \" Video Stopwatch \" (As seen in fig 14 ) .The video recorded had a 30 FPS (frames per second) thus each frame lasts for 33.33 ms and this is our least count. This exercises was done 3 times and the average was calculated. Angle(degree) time (trial1) (in s) time (trial2) (in s) time (trial3) (in s) Mean time (in s) lift of bench (cm) --------------- ---------------------- ---------------------- ---------------------- ------------------ -------------------- 2 3.5 3.433 3.433 3.455 6 4 2.567 2.567 2.567 2.567 12 6 2.067 2.033 2.033 2.044 18 8 1.733 1.8 1.767 1.767 24 10 1.633 1.633 1.633 1.633 30 12 1.467 1.433 1.433 1.444 35.8 14 1.3 1.333 1.333 1.322 41.6 16 1.267 1.2 1.267 1.245 47.4 After these sets of measurement, a kitchen anti slip mat was added on top of the bench surface. The time taken to roll down is measured again for 6 degree and 8 degree. The time measured thus is 2.033 s and 1.733 s respectively. This is similar to the one without surface modification thus rolling time is independent of surface (which is also clear from the formula for t Eq: [eq:time] ). Measurement of weight of belan The weight of the belan was calculated using a kitchen weighing scale.The least count of the used measuring scale was 1g. It was found that the weight of the belan used in this experiment is 172 \\(\\pm\\) 1 g. Plots Attached outside the report in the form of 2 images. Calculation of moment of inertia of the belan From eq [eq:time] $$t=\\sqrt{\\frac{2S(1+I/mR&#94;{2})}{g\\sin\\theta}}$$ so $$I=mR&#94;{2}(\\frac{t&#94;{2}g\\sin\\theta}{2S}-1)$$ let us take R as the weighted mean of \\(R_{1}\\) and \\(R_{2}\\) . The weights can be chosen (assumed) as the fraction of total length that \\(R_{i}\\) appears in the cylinder. The fraction of length with \\(R_{1}\\) is 17/35.8 and that for \\(R_{2}\\) is 18.8/35.8. Thus R using these weights become \\(\\frac{aR_{1}+bR_{2}}{a+b}=1.28\\pm(0.01+0.02)=1.28\\pm0.03\\) cm. Using theses values and the vales from 2 degree angle data, and g=9.81m \\(/s&#94;{2}\\) we calculate I as 0.0000074312 Kg \\(m&#94;{2}\\) = 74.312 g \\(cm&#94;{2}\\) $$\\frac{\\Delta I}{I}=\\frac{\\Delta m}{m}+2\\frac{\\Delta R}{R}+2\\frac{\\Delta t}{t}+cos\\theta\\Delta\\theta+\\frac{\\Delta S}{S}$$ calculating these with the previously mentioned error fractions, $$\\frac{\\Delta I}{I}=0.073410$$ $$\\Delta I=0.00000054552Kgm&#94;{2}=5.45gcm&#94;{2}$$ Therefore I = 74.312 \\(\\pm5.45gcm&#94;{2}\\) . Calculation of coefficient of friction In the limiting case where frictional force can no longer support rolling of the cylinder, thus the cylinder begins to slip. In my case the \\(\\theta max\\) was found to be 55 degree. Using eq [eq:mu] $$\\mu=\\frac{I\\tan\\theta_{max}}{mR&#94;{2}+I}$$ we get \\(\\mu=0.298\\sim0.3\\) $$\\frac{\\Delta\\mu}{\\mu}=\\frac{\\Delta I}{I}+2\\frac{\\Delta R}{R}+\\frac{\\Delta m}{m}+cot\\theta\\Delta\\theta$$ $$\\frac{\\Delta\\mu}{\\mu}=0.15473$$ Therefore \\(\\Delta\\mu=0.046,\\) thus \\(\\mu=0.298\\pm0.046\\) Results & Conclusion The moment of inertia of belan is found to be 74.312 \\(\\pm5.45gcm&#94;{2}\\) The relation ship between rolling time and the inclination angle is \\(t=\\sqrt{\\frac{2S(1+I/mR&#94;{2})}{g\\sin\\theta}}\\) The coefficient of friction of the surface is found to be \\(\\mu=0.298\\pm0.046\\) . The rolling time is independent of surface friction (as long as \\(f_{s}>mg\\sin\\theta\\) ).

You can use pandoc to produce an HTML + JavaScript slide presentation that can be viewed via a web browser. There are five ways to do this, using S5 , DZSlides , Slidy , Slideous , or reveal.js . You can also produce a PDF slide show using LaTeX beamer , or slides shows in Microsoft PowerPoint format. This article mainly covers generating slides in LaTeX beamer format, which is what is used extensively in academia. If you are not familiar with markdown, you can take a look at the following markdown source for a simple beamer slide show, Demo.md : --- title: - AI Playground author: - Ashwin Kumar K theme: - Copenhagen date: - March 22, 2020 --- # What's AI? - Artificial Intelligence- The ability of machine to think and behave like humans. - How does the machine learn on its own? - That is called Machine Learning.

The slides generated from this markdown can bee seen here When you compare the source and the resulting pdf that it generates, you notice the general rules that a markdown document follows. For instance, you can create a slide show broken up into sections (slides) by using the # tag and you can use ## tags for sub heading. You can also create a new slide without a header using a horizontal rule (â€”-). You can insert latex equations by going to math mode (Insert the equation in $ $ ) To produce an HTML /JavaScript slide show, simply run the following command in your favourite terminal: pandoc -t FORMAT -s Demo.txt -o Demo.html where FORMAT is either s5 , slidy , slideous , dzslides , or revealjs . To produce a PDF slide show using LaTeX beamer , type pandoc -t beamer Demo.txt -o Demo.pdf Note that a reveal.js slide show can also be converted to a PDF by printing it to a file from the browser. To produce a Powerpoint slide show, type pandoc Demo.txt -o Demo.pptx You get the idea. Structuring the slide show By default, the slide level is the highest heading level in the hierarchy that is followed immediately by content, and not another heading, somewhere in the document. In the example above, level-1 headings are always followed by level-2 headings, which are followed by content, so the slide level is 2. This default can be overridden using the --slide-level option. The document is carved up into slides according to the following rules: A horizontal rule always starts a new slide. A heading at the slide level always starts a new slide. Headings below the slide level in the hierarchy create headings within a slide. Headings above the slide level in the hierarchy create \"title slides,\" which just contain the section title and help to break the slide show into sections. Non-slide content under these headings will be included on the title slide (for HTML slide shows) or in a subsequent slide with the same title (for beamer). A title page is constructed automatically from the document's title block, if present. (In the case of beamer, this can be disabled by commenting out some lines in the default template.) These rules are designed to support many different styles of slide show. If you don't care about structuring your slides into sections and subsections, you can just use level-1 headings for all each slide. (In that case, level-1 will be the slide level.) But you can also structure the slide show into sections, as in the example above. Note: in reveal.js slide shows, if slide level is 2, a two-dimensional layout will be produced, with level-1 headings building horizontally and level-2 headings building vertically. It is not recommended that you use deeper nesting of section levels with reveal.js. Incremental lists By default, these writers produces lists that display \"all at once\". If you want your lists to display incrementally (one item at a time), use the -i option. If you want aparticular list to depart from the default (that is, to display incrementally without the -i option and all at once with the -i option), put it in a block quote: > - Eat spaghetti > - Drink wine In this way incremental and non-incremental lists can be mixed in a single document. Styling the slides To style beamer slides, you can specify a beamer \"theme\" or \"colortheme\" using the -V option: pandoc -t beamer Demo.txt -V theme:Warsaw -o Demo.pdf for more settings visit Pandoc Manual and bookdown.org","tags":"Blog","url":"https://ashwinschronicles.github.io/beamer-slides-using-markdown-and-pandoc","loc":"https://ashwinschronicles.github.io/beamer-slides-using-markdown-and-pandoc"},{"title":"Battery Management  System for an xEV - Part 1","text":"This is part 1 of a series on Battery management system design. The data presented here was collected as a part of study based Internship at Kaynes Technology, Mysore. Most of the data here is my notes on the following resources: \" Battery Management Systems, Volume I & II \" by Gregory L. Plett along with his course. \" Advances in Battery Technologies for Electric Vehicles\" (Woodhead Publishing Series in Energy: Number 80) \" ELECTRIC VEHICLE BATTERY SYSTEMS \" by Sandeep Dhameja \" Battery Reference Book\" 3e by T.R Crompton. Basic terminologies Batteries and battery packs are made up from groups of cells wired in series, parallel or a combination of them. Nominal Voltage is a representative voltage that depends on the combination of the active chamicals used. It dosent relate to the voltage under load, its more of an average or typical voltage. C rate is a relative measure of the cell electrical current eg. A 20 Ah cell should be able to deliver 20 A (\"1C\") for 1 h or 2 A (\"C/10\") for about 10 h (but, the relationship is not strictly linear) A cell stores energy in electrochemical form, which it can later release to do work, The energy release rate is the cell's instantaneous power (mW, W, or kW) xEVs: Electric vehicles come in different categories and are abbreviated as xEVs Hybrid-electric vehicles (HEVs) These vehicles have drive provided by an electric motor and one other source ( like petrol engine ). The battery pack in these systems store small amount of energy and are used only for power boost when the vehicle must accelerate, or as a power sink when the vehicle must decelerate. They essentially have zero all-electric vehicle range and are never plugged in to recharge their battery pack; instead, the gasoline engine recharges the battery when extra power is available. An example HEV is the Toyota Prius. Plug-in hybrid-electric vehicles (PHEVs) . These vehicles are similar to HEVs but have a somewhat larger battery pack and motor. They can operate in electric-only mode under some operating conditions, typically at lower speeds such as for residential or city driving Extended-Range Electric Vehicle (E- REV ): Larger battery than PHEV allows some all-electric range under full-load conditions. Electric Vehicle ( EV ), a.k.a. Battery-Electric Vehicle ( BEV ): Battery provides only motive power. What must a BMS do? The primary functions of a BMS are to: Protect human safety of device's operator: Detect unsafe operating conditions and respond Protect cells of battery from damage in abuse/failure cases Prolong life of battery (normal operating cases) Maintain battery in a state in which it can fulfil its functional design requirements Inform the application controller how to make the best use of the pack right now (e.g., by providing power limits), control charger, etc. Basic working of an electrochemical cell The function of the negative electrode In an electrochemical cell, the negative electrode is often a metal or an alloy or hydrogen (lead metal or paste for PbA) During discharge, it gives up electrons to external circuit, is oxidized ( OIL ) During charge, accepts electrons from external circuit, is reduced The function of the positive electrode In an electrochemical cell, the positive electrode is often a metallic oxide, sulfide, or oxygen (lead oxide for PbA) During discharge, accepts electrons from circuit, is reduced During charge, gives up electrons to external circuit, is oxidized Li-ion working (The process of intercalation) Discharge process: During discharge, Li exits the surface of the negative-electrode particles, gives up an electron, becoming Li in the electrolyte Li diffuses outward from center of negative-electrode particles to equalize concentrations, replenishing Li at particle surface (over time) Meanwhile, electron travels through external circuit to positive electrode Li joins with the electron, and Li enters positive-electrode particles at their surface Li diffuses into positive-electrode particles to equalize concentration (over time) The active electrode materials are coated on both sides of metallic foils which act as the current collectors conducting the current into and out of the cell Negative electrodes for lithium-ion cells Presently, essentially all commercial lithium-ion cells use some form of graphite (C6 ) for the negative-electrode material Graphite has graphene layers of C6 structures that are tightly bonded These layers are loosely stacked and there is room for lithium to intercalate between them Alternate negative-electrode material LTO Lithium titanate oxide (Li4 Ti5 O12 , LTO ) is an alternative negative-electrode material Disadvantage: high open-circuit potential (making cell voltage low) Advantage: nearly indestructible â€” very long life Future negative-electrode material silicon Using graphite, one can store up to one Li per six C atoms; using silicon, one can (in principle) store four Li per every Si atom! Unfortunately, while volume change for a charge/discharge cycle for graphite is around 10 %, it is around 400 % for silicon Therefore, silicon electrodes tend to fracture quickly and have short lives Possible workarounds: mix graphite with silicon, or build small forests of silicon nanowires with space in-between to allow for expansion Positive electrodes for lithium-ion cells Lithium cobalt oxide ( LCO ) In 1980, John B. Goodenough discovered that Lix CoO2 ( LCO ) was a viable material for lithium intercalation Li intercalates between the layers of CoO6 octahedra LCO has layers, somewhat like graphite, so it is often called a \"layered cathode\" Disadavntages: Cobalt is rare, toxic, and expensive; Only about half its theoretic capacity is useable (\"x\" can be min 0.5), else cell ages rapidly NCM (a.k.a. NMC ) is a blend of Ni, Co, and Mn, which retains the layered structure, and has properties from all three constituent metals; NCA is a blend of Ni, Co, and Al (used in tesla batteries) Spinel cathodes In 1983, Goodenough and Thackery proposed LixMn2O4 ( LMO ) as an alternate intercalation material: Mn sits in the octahedral sites, Li in the tetrahedral This material has a cubic \"spinel\" structure. It allows 3D diffusion (vs. 2D for layered and 1D for olivine) LMO is cheaper and safer than LCO , but can have short lifetime due to the manganese dissolving into the electrolyte under some conditions Additives can be added to help prevent this, but this \"art\" is presently well guarded by trade secrets Olivine cathodes In 1997, Goodenough proposed olivine-style phosphates as a third major category of positive-electrode material LixFePO4 ( LFP ) is the most common in this family This material is low cost, and low toxicity, but also has low energy density due to a low open-circuit potential and low specific energy due to heaviness of Fe 1D structure tends to have high resistance, which can be overcome in part by using very small particles and including conductive additives In summary Layered cathodes ( LCO , NMC , NCA ) can use only around half their theoretic capacity Olivine cathodes ( LFP ) have low voltage (and very little state information in their voltage) Spinel cathodes ( LMO ) are inexpensive and non-toxic, but can degrade rapidly What are the primary functions of a BMS ? A BMS has the following priorities: Protects safety of the operator of the host application; detects unsafe operating conditions and responds Protects cells of battery from damage in abuse/failure cases Prolongs life of battery (normal operating cases) Maintains battery in a state in which it can fulfill its functional design requirements Informs the host-application control computer how to make the best use of the pack right now (e.g., power limits), control charger, etc. 1. Sensing and high-voltage control Measure voltage, current,temperature; control contactor, pre-charge; ground-fault detection,thermal management 2.

Performance management State-of-charge ( SOC ) estimation,power-limit computation,balance/equalize cells 5. Diagnostics Abuse detection, state-of-health ( SOH ) estimation, state-of-life ( SOL ) estimation The issue of cost There is a cost associated with battery management, so not all applications implement all features Modular design of BMS Design extreme 1: Parallel-cell modules ( PCM ) Design extreme 2: Series-cell modules ( SCM ) A modular battery pack suggests a hierarchical masterâ€“slave BMS design as well One \"slave\" BMS unit is associated with each module Module's cells welded/bolted to slave PCB , minimizing wiring and wiring losses Slave has electronics for voltage measurement, cell balancing There is then normally a single \"master\" unit for each pack Master measures pack current, controls contactors Communicates with slaves via daisy-chain or star architecture Master/slave communication uses few (e.g. two) wiresâ€”minimizes wiring-harness nightmare BMS slave role BMS slave needs to: Measure voltage of every cell within the module Measure temperatures Ideally of every cell, but in many packs some temperatures are estimated, especially if the pack has cells in parallel Balance the energy stored in every cell within the module this is needed as cells have different efficiencies, self-discharge rates, etc. Communicate this information to the master Is slave design reusable? Often \"yes\", assuming electronics flexible in terms of number of cells monitored, physical size matches different applications While electronics design may be reusable in most cases, may need to redesign PCB footprint to fit individual applications For high volumes there may be overall cost savings in developing a specific slave optimized for a given module BMS master role BMS master needs to Control contactors that connect battery to load Monitor pack current, isolation Communicate with BMS slaves Communicate with host- application controller Control thermal-management Is master design reusable? More difficult than for slave designs Master needs to be more flexible; for example, Number and type of contactors it controls Types of current sensors used Ways it connects to charger, thermal management system 1a. Battery-pack sensing: Voltage All cell voltages are measured in a lithium-ion pack Indicator of relative balance of cells Input to most SOC and SOH estimation algorithms Safety: overcharging a lithium-ion cell can lead to \"thermal runaway,\" so we cannot skip measuring any voltages Some methods for analog-to-digital conversion At the most basic level, voltage is measured using an analog-o-digital converter There are several common ADC architectures; for example, A direct-conversion or flash ADC uses a bank of comparators and fixed reference voltages, outputs code of closest reference (fast, expensive) Successive approximation compares input to output from DAC and uses feedback to modify DAC signal, resolving input to desired accuracy (slow, inexpensive) Delta-sigma uses oversampled 1-bit flash ADC to encode difference ( ) between approximation and input, sums ( ) differences and filters to give final high-resolution result at desired slower sample rate (very popular) The resolution of an ADC is the smallest change in the input signal that can be measured; it is also the step size between consecutive ADC output codes (typically 16bit adc has a resolution of 76uV) Resolution for a M bit ADC is the full scale voltage difference divided by 2 to the power of M Accuracy of an ADC The accuracy of an ADC has to do with the absolute difference between the reported value and the true value:difference may be due to several sources Quantization error (unmeasurable value between) Offset error (constant difference between ideal and measured value over whole measurement range) Gain error (difference between slope of ideal and measured value over whole measurement range, expressed as %) Nonlinear error (deviation between actual and ideal step widths, expressed as ADC counts) Chipsets Special chipsets are made to aid high-voltage BMS design Low-cost \"dumb\" measurement chips used in modules, proximate to cells; high-cost computational processing in distant master unit Special chips implement difficult task of highly accurate A2D voltage sensing with high common-mode rejection and fast response in high- EMI , high-heat, high-vibration environments Can often be placed in parallel for redundant fault-tolerant designs. Multiple vendors make chipsets (e.g., Analog Devices, Maxim, Texas Instruments) Example chipset: LTC6811 example ( LTC6811 ) designed by Analog Devices (formerly Linear Technology) Monitors up to 12 cells in series in a module, 100s of cells in series in pack Has built-in isolated communications between daisy-chained parts Supports internal or external cell- equalization circuitry Powered by module itself, or externally Measures up to five temperatures (more with some external circuitry) Selecting a chipset Points to be considered in a design: How many cells can each IC monitor? How many cells total can be monitored? Does it support passive/active balancing? What is the measurement accuracy? How many temperature measurements can be made? How many wires to communicate from IC to IC ? What is chipset availability and cost, per cell? 1b. Battery-pack sensing: Temperature Battery cell operational characteristics and cell degradation rates are very strong functions of temperature Don't charge at low temperature; control thermal management systems to keep temperature in \"safe\" region Unexpected temperature changes can indicate cell failure or impending safety concern Ideally, we measure each cell's internal temperature; but, With accurate pack thermal model, can place sensors external to one or more cells per module and calibrate internal temperature Measurement devices: Thermocouple (uses amplifier and ADC ) Thermistor (uses voltage divider circuit) Voltage-divider + thermistor example 1c. Battery-pack sensing: Current Battery pack electrical current must be measured to monitor safety, log abuse, and inform SOC and SOH algorithms Using : Shunt current sensor (Kelvin four-wire) Hall-effect current sensing Both methods have advantages and disadvantages and both are in common use in BMS today 1d: High-voltage contactor control When not in use, the battery pack internal high-voltage bus is completely disconnected from the load at both terminals Dis/connecting pack at both terminals requires two high-current capable relays or \"contactors\" A low-voltage/low-current signal activates the contactor, closing an internal switch that connects its main terminals As load is often capacitive, if both contactors were closed simultaneously, enormous current would flow instantly, potentially welding the contactors closed or blowing a fuse So, a third \"pre-charge\" contactor is used Contactor procedure: 1e. Isolation sensing Isolation sensing detects presence of a ground fault Primary concern is safety: Is it safe to touch a battery terminal and chassis ground at the same time? Battery \"should\" be completely isolated from chassis ground, so \"should\" be no problem FMVSS says isolation is sufficient if less than 2 mA of current will flow when connecting chassis ground to either the positive or negative terminal of the battery pack via a direct short Procedure: For fault on low side Isolation is deemed sufficient if Ri>Vb /0.002 or R1 > 500Vb 1f. Thermal control Important to keep battery-pack cells at a \"comfortable\"temperature to ensure safety and to extend life Also important to keep cells at a uniform temperature for consistent aging (also reduces need for many temperature sensors) Present commercial systems use either air or liquid systems, and some reports indicate that range and life are negatively impacted by air systems Active heating and cooling while vehicle plugged in can extend life, shorten charge times How can a BMS protect the user and battery pack? BMS requirement 2: Protection BMS must provide monitoring and control to protect: Cells from out-of-tolerance ambient operating conditions User from consequences of battery failures High-energy storage batteries can be very dangerous: If energy is released in an uncontrolled way (short circuit, physical damage), can have catastrophic consequences In a short circuit, hundreds of amperes can develop in microseconds; protection circuitry must act quickly state What to protect against Different applications and different cell chemistries require different degrees of protection Failure in a lithium-ion cell can be very serious: explosion/fire Protection is indispensable in automotive environment Protection must address following undesirable events or conditions: Excessive current during charging or discharging Short circuit Over voltage and under voltage High ambient temperature, overheating Loss of isolation Abuse Overcurrent/overtemperature protection When possible, fallback protection paths should be implemented Red = cell-manufacturer specified region where cells will most likely be subject to permanent damage Anywhere else \"okay\" but need a margin of error Generally design to limit cell's operating conditions to smaller \"safe\" region, shown here in green Safety devices are then specified to constrain cells to safe region White = safety margin Overvoltage/overtemperature protection Similar for voltage limits: But, each protection device added into main current path increases battery impedance, reducing power delivered to load Examples of protection devices include: Thermal fuse: Opens contactor when the temperature exceeds limit. Conventional fuse: May not act quickly enough Active fault detection: BMS monitoring for fault conditions Fault detection/tolerance Another aspect of protection is detecting, withstanding, and (when possible) rectifying faults State-of-art BMS use processors having dual CPUs that execute the same instructions at slightly different times on different cores, then compare results Slaves often can detect most cell faults without intervention of the main processor Cell over/under voltage, over/under temperature, redundant sensing, etc. Serious slave faults should be able to shut pack down without using master microprocessor Some more complex faults (for example isolation) must be detected by the software(Algorithm) The link between master and slaves must have high EMI immunity Standards Different applications have different standards for safety Passenger cars having maximum gross vehicle mass up to 3500 kg fall under ISO26262 :2011 Electric motorcycles fall under ISO / PAS 19695:2015 (similar to ISO26262 ) Larger trucks over 3500 kg, such as Ford F250, 350, Chevy Silverado 2500, as well as semis, buses, etcâ€¦) fall under IEC61508 While these safety standards have the same goals they are different in application Use different \"safety integrity levels\" (SILs), evaluated in different ways Very difficult to design to all these standards simultaneously Standards are complexâ€”require study of their own to understand how to comply most likely 40% of the code written for BMS is to ensure these standards. 3 How must a BMS interface with other system components? 3a. Communication via CAN bus Control Area Network ( CAN ) bus is industry ISO standard foron-board vehicle communications Designed to provide robust communications in the very harsh automotive operating environments with high levels of electrical noise Two-wire serial bus designed to network intelligent sensors and actuators; can operate at two rates: High speed (e.g., 1M Baud): Used for critical operations such as engine management, vehicle stability, motion control Low speed (e.g., 100 kBaud): Simple switching and control of lighting, windows, mirror adjustments, and instrument displays (etc.) Format of CAN -bus packet The protocol defines the following: Method of addressing the devices connected to the bus Data format (the \"message\") Transmission speed, priority settings, and sequence Error detection and handling Control signals A typical packet(frame) in CAN bus looks like : Abbreviations : SOF - Start of frame; RTR - Ready to receive; CRC - cyclic redundancy check; ACK -acknowledgement bit Data frames are transmitted sequentially over the bus. 3b. Charger control Battery packs are charged in two ways: Random: Charge delivered in unpredictable patterns; e.g., regenerative braking and are Control by providing inverter power limits Plug-in: For EV / PHEV /E- REV Control charger current, voltage, balancing Often CP / CV ; more exotic methods possible (in the research phase) Heating systems may be required to increase charge efficiency and to increase battery longevity What limits fast charging? Passenger vehicles require approximately 200â€“300 Wh / mile For 300 mile range, 60â€“90 kWh capacity, charge in 3 min (typical petrol refill time) . requires a rate of up to 1.8 MW ! Domestic 15 A 110 V ( US ) or 1 5 kW \"level 1\" service charges pack in 40â€“60 h Domestic 30 A 220 V ( US - high power sockets) or 6 6 kW \"level 2\" service charges pack in 10â€“15 h DC \"level 3\" (CHAdeMO) fast charging, 500 V, 125 A can provide up to 80 % charge in 30 min Tesla \"level 3\" fast charging for model S can provide 50 % charge in 20 min So, limit is usually the electrical service, not the battery pack 3c. Log book function For warranty and diagnostic purposes, BMS must store a log of atypical/abuse events Abuse type: out of tolerance, voltage, current, temperature Duration and magnitude of abuse Can also store diagnostic information regarding Number of charge/discharge cycles completed SOH estimates at the beginning of each driving cycle And much moreâ€¦ Data stored in nonvolatile (e.g., FLASH ) memory and downloaded when required 3d. Range estimation How far can I drive before available energy is depleted? Heavily influenced by environmental factors: What are the vehicle characteristics? How is the vehicle being driven (gently/aggressively)? Are there a lot of hills, a lot of wind? Is it warm or cold out? At present, it appears that each OEM will have their own range algorithms BMS requirement 4: Performance management Battery applications need to know two battery quantities: How much energy is available in the battery pack How much power is available in the immediate future Knowing energy is most important for applications such as EV : Tells me how far I can drive Knowing power is most important for applications such as HEV : Tells me whether I can accelerate or accept braking charge Both are important for applications such as E- REV / PHEV Why must we estimate energy, power? We Can't measure available energy or available power directly. Instead, must estimate these values. To estimate energy, we must know (atleast) all cell states-of-charge Zk and capacities Qk To estimate power, we must know (atleast) all cell states-of-charge Zk and internal resistances Rk But, cannot directly measure these parameters either! Therefore, must estimate SOC , SOH Available inputs include all cell voltages, pack current, and temperatures of cells or modules. There are both good and poor methods to produce estimates: Poor methods are generally simpler to understand, code, and validate, but yield less-accurate results Impacts of a poor estimator can be: Abrupt corrections when voltage or current limits exceeded, leading to customer perception of poor drivability, or Overcharge or overdischarge, which damages cells, or Compensating for uncertainty by overdesigning pack All of these have costs in dollars, weight and/or volume A good way to do SOC estimate is to implement Kalman filter Whats left to explore ?

If you are using windows on your primary laptop, you have a host of applications that does this for you (like Builtin windows Wireless display, Synergy) but if you are using linux you can follow the following instructions. Assumptions I will list the steps on how to get it done wit the following configuration: The laptop screen is eDP-1 We are using the VIRTUAL1 output for the VNC server The resolution of the VNC monitor will be 1920x1080 We are extending the desktop to the right of the laptop's screen Step 1: Generate modeline for the resolution of the vpn screen you are going to use with your VNC display. If xrandr already show the desired mode for any of the displays, generating a new one is not needed, we can use the existing one. If this is the case, you can jump directly to step 3. Any random number can be used for the frequency, as we are not using the mode with any real monitor. gtf 1920 1080 60 This command generates the following modeline: # 1920x1080 @ 60.00 Hz (GTF) hsync: 67.08 kHz; pclk: 172.80 MHz Modeline \"1920x1080_60.00\" 172 .80 1920 2040 2248 2576 1080 1081 1084 1118 -HSync +Vsync Step 2: Generate a new mode based on the modeline we got from step 1. xrandr --newmode \"1920x1080_60.00\" 172 .80 1920 2040 2248 2576 1080 1081 1084 1118 -HSync +Vsync Step 3: Add the desired mode to our disconnected output: xrandr --addmode VIRTUAL1 1920x1080_60.00 Step 4: Enable the disconnected monitor using the newly added mode and use it to extend the desktop to the right of eDP1: xrandr --output VIRTUAL1 --mode 1920x1080_60.00 --right-of eDP1 This extends your desktop to the invisible monitor on your left. At this point you can't see it's picture but you can move your mouse there and drag your windows there. if your hardware dosnet support VIRTUAL1 , you can also use VGA1 instead of VIRTUAL1 Step 5: Run xrandr to check if the new setup is listed. Step 6: Export the invisible part of your desktop using VNC x11vnc -clip 1920x1080+1920+0 Step 7: VNC viewer Some kind of VNC viewer that supports showing the remote cursor is needed on your secondary laptop / tablet. Both of them needs to be on the same network and they need to be discover-able. After that you are asked the ip address of the remote computer. If your not happy with the performance of the setup you can use NoMachine instead of VNC viewer, it uses NX protocoal and seems to be better optimised for low bandwidth and low performance device (the secondary laptop).

The temperature range can be as low as few milli-kelvin in Dilution refrigerators. Most common ones are either liquid Helium based which can cool to below 10 K or are liquid Nitrogen based, which can cool to about 80 K which is Nitrogen's boiling point. The sample is mounted on something called as the probe, which houses electrical wires connecting the sample to the instruments used for various measurements. Cryostats can be closed cycle ones, or continuous flow systems. In closed cycle cryostat the cold cryogen (refrigerant) is pumped to the sample chamber and the warm cryogen is extracted and cooled and then recycled into the system. Continuous-flow cryostats are cooled by liquid cryogens from a storage dewar. As the cryogen boils within the cryostat, it is continuously replenished by a steady flow from the storage dewar. The cryostat at Superconductivity Lab, NISER , for which I had to develop the probe tip, is a customised closed system cryostat provided by ColdEdge. The key features of this cryostat is large sample space and fast cooling. In the large sample space (aka sample well), helium gas is purged (at <0.5 psi pressure) which cools the sample by convection cooling methods. The helium gas is provided from an external gas cylinder. A 0.5 psi relief valve is present for safety in case the sample space becomes over pressurised. The cooling part of the system is called cold head. It removes heat from the compressors incoming gas by expansion through an internal displacer. The displacer is filled with regenerative material that also helps with the cooling of the gas. The compressor is part of the cryo-cooler system which cycles helium gas to and from the cold head. It contains an absorber which is used to filter out impurities from the gas which may cause cool down problems for the cold head. The sample space is attached directly to the cold head and achieves the temperature range (4 - 325K) of the cold head. The sample is attached to the probe which is plunged into cold helium gas inside the sample well. Since the interface remains cold and the probe stick can be removed from the cold interface without having to warm up and break vacuum, different samples can be examined quickly. By default, the cryostat comes with two Cernox temperature sensors, one for the cold head and the other on the probe to measure sample temperature. Cernox is the best suitable sensor for such low temperature high magnetic field regions. A vacuum jacket (aka vacuum shroud) is placed over the Cold Head and sample well, which acts as an insulator between the Cold Head and ambient room temperature. It will ensure that ice does not build up on the cooler. Power to the cold head is supplied through the compressor. A load lock above the sample space, helps to insert the probe without having to warm up and break vacuum of sample space. It is best to control the heater using the Cernox sensor on the outside of the well rather than using the Cernox sensor on the sample stick. Uniformly heating the outside of the well and adjusting the set point relative to the stick sensor will be much easier than trying to compensate for the convection currents internally in the well. Design and Fabrication of Probe Design The probe design was made keeping in mind thermal equilibrium of sample and temperature sensor and to maximize the number of connections one can make in a sample. The company for the cryostat had given us a basic stick support structure for the dipstick, which looks like Fig 1 The lower end of this structure has a temperature sensor and a heater, so a probe tip had to be designed that can do measurements efficiently. The design finalized is as shown in Fig 2 . In this design, the brown square part is the copper sheet, the green sheet is an RC filter for all the input wires, and the sample is the purple one, the sample holder pcb can be connected and disconnected to the RC filter PCB , this is so that the sample holder can be removed and taken to the wire bonder etc. There are two versions of this support, the magnetic base (aka flat base)and the non magnetic base (aka square base). In both the case, the 10 pins of each side are connected in parallel. Hence in one go, one can measure at most 10 pads or 4 (2) samples. Next we had to design the PCB which included an RC low pass filter and a sample holder, the design which was finalised is shown in Fig 3 it was designed using a free online service called www.easyeda.com . The RC filter parameters are \\(f_c\\) = 1000Hz, R=150 ohm, C = 10 \\(\\mu\\) F. Another version of the square support is the flat support which supports using magnetic coils for magnetic measurements is as shown in fig 3 The RC filter works by using capacitor and resistor to attenuate high frequency noise. A circuit diagram for the same can be seen in Fig 5 . The characteristic bode plot expected for a functioning RC filter is shown in Fig 6 . Fabrication The pcbs were designed and then sent to www.jlcpcb.com for fabrication of PCB . The electronic components required for the board were ordered from www.lcsc.com. The delivered product is shown in Fig 7 . The base was made in house using copper sheets which were cut using an angle grinder to the required measurements. The joints were fixed by brazing it with copper. The finished probe ends are seen in Fig 8 . For measurement purpose, a sample of sputtered Nb thin film (55nm) was stuck on the copper base of the holder and wire bonding was done in 4 probe arrangement. The sample after wire-bonding is in fig 8 . The wiring for the probes were made with 37 gauge enameled copper wire twisted in pairs (Fig 9 ). The pin out for the connector can be found in Table 1 . The pads of the sample are connected to the break out box (fig 22 ). Software for data acquisition The signal from the sample is fed into the temperature controller and Source meter unit. The data from these instruments is gathered using a software written in Labview. A schematic of data flow is in Fig 10 . All the software tools required for data acquisition is compiled into a Labview project file \"MeasurementLibrary.lvproj\". A shortcut to this file is kept in desktop (Fig 11 ). When the project file is opened, A list of all the available programs is shown (Fig 12 ) This software suite consists of 4 probe resistance measurement interface (\"B2912A_4probe_ohms.vi\") Basic GPIB communication tester (\"basic_gpib_write_and_read.vi\") LS336 Heater Output Configuration Panel (\" LS336 Configure Heater Output Control Parameters and Acquire Single Reading.vi\") LS336 Temperature Logger (\"LS336_read_2temperature.vi\") Basic RT ,Tt Plotter (\"Plot_RT_Graph.vi\" and \"Plot_Tvst.vi\") RT Logger with Temperature controller (\"RT_measurement.vi\") Let us look at the functioning of each program one by one. 4 probe resistance measurement interface The 4 probe resistance measurement interface is shown in Fig 13 . The software takes in the SMU VISA name (hardware address) and all the resistance measurement mode settings and does a single measurement. The hardware address for LS336 is GPIB0 ::1:: INSTR and that for the SMU is GPIB0 ::2:: INSTR (or USB :xxxx in case it is connected via serial). Note: If you change some parameter, when you close the program there might be a confirmation to save changes (Like Fig 14 .) ALWAYS CLICK \" DONT SAVE ALL \", this is to ensure no pre-configured parameter gets changed by accident. Basic GPIB communication tester The interface for Basic GPIB communication tester is shown in Fig 15 . This tool allows you to debug GPIB connections and to check the state of the instrument. After selecting the right Hardware address, ( VISA Resource name) you can write any serial SCPI commands in the Write buffer and when you execute the program the instruments response is shown in read buffer. Typical serial SCPI commands include: \\*IDN? - Identify \\*RST - Reset \\*OPC? - Operation complete query \\*CLS - Clear Status . LS336 Heater Output Configuration Panel The interface for LS336 Heater Output Configuration Panel is shown in Fig 16 . This software initializes the instrument, allows the user to determine if heater output control parameters and setpoint values are sent, takes a single sensor reading, and then closes the instrument. LS336 Temperature Logger The interface for LS336 Temperature Logger is shown in Fig 17 . This software logs the sensor reading (of two inputs), and then saves the data in a tab separated file specified by the user. Basic RT ,Tt Plotter The interface for Basic RT ,Tt Plotter is shown in Fig 18 . The application takes in a tab separated text file containing data of index,V,I,R, \\(T_(coldhead)\\) , \\(T_(sample)\\) (obtained from temperature logger or RT Logger with Temperature controller )and then plots the RT , Tt graphs with T being the \\(T_(sample)\\) . RT Logger with Temperature controller The interface for RT Logger with Temperature controller is shown in Fig 19 . This application is basically all the above utilities put in one. There are two tabs, one for controls, the other for viewing the plots. In the control tab, one can set the parameters for SMU as well as Temperature controller. When the application is executed with the correct parameters set, the data of index,V,I,R, \\(T_(coldhead)\\) , \\(T_(sample)\\) are stored in a tab separated text file at user specified location. The controls on the temperature controller side might look daunting at first, however a quick glance of LS336 manual clears up all the parameters. List of procedures Cryostat connections. The connections of Vacuum jacket, Vacuum pump, Pirani gauge, load lock and the valves can be made as shown in Fig 20 . The temperature sensor connections are to be made as in Fig 21 . The temperature sensor on the probe needs to be connected to Input B and that of the Cold Head to Input C (This is needed as the proper curves are chosen for this particular arrangement). The heater on the probe needs to be connected to Output 2 (50W) and that of the Cold head to Output 1(100W). Both the heaters are 50 Ohm heaters. The break out for the pads on the sample holder can be accessed through the break out box (Fig 22 .) Each wire from the Hermetic connector is colour coded (as in Fig 23 ), the pin-out for the same is in Table . NOTE : Never create vacuum in sample space, the rubber bellows can get torn under vacuum. Check connections for leaks. After making the connections,vacuum the vacuum pipe( turn off the Load Lock Valve ,turn on the Pirani Gauge). now slowly turn on the Vacuum Valve and . Wait till 10E-3 Torr of vacuum is achieved. Spray all joints with Isopropanol and watch for a spike in vacuum. If spraying Isopropanol over any joint causes a spike in vacuum, you know that you have a small leak. Re-grease 0- rings and recheck. Any debris on the O-ring or inside the O-ring groove will certainly cause a leak path and will be noticeable . Purging the Interface. Before turning the system on (after a long gap) you will need to purge the interface to remove any air that is trapped inside the sample well. This step is not required in regular use. This step can also help in getting a clear view through view port ( Fig 24 ) by removing some condensation. Supply about \\~0.5 psi of pressure to the gas inlet of the cryostat through the regulator. ( NOTE : Supplying more than 20 psi to the Regulator may cause damage to the internal diaphragm. ) NOTE : If the sample well is not free of moisture and/or air it will cause the gas inlet tube to freeze below liquid Nitrogen temperatures. When this occurs the sample well will start to create vacuum and will suck the bellows into the well, potentially ripping or forcing the bellows from it's clamp. Starting the system (Cool Down). Turn on the water cooler (set at 15 degree Celsius) 30 minutes before hand. You can check if the cooler is turned on or not by feeling vibration of water moving through the pipe. After few minutes both the pipes should feel cold to touch. Make sure that there is no leak in any connections. Turn the gas regulator to about 10psi. Make sure that He is flowing in the sample chamber. Turn On the compressor. Once the compressor is turned on, you will hear the Cryocooler begin to start pumping. The Cryocooler will take approximately 120 minutes to cool down. Now that the Cryocooler is running, maintaining the 0.5 psi pressure on the sample well will be critical for the sample to reach minimum temperature. If the cryostat is not able to reach its desired temperature then one of the reason can be empty cylinder. As the cooler gets colder it gets denser and falls to the bottom of the well. The interface will pull more gas into the system as it cools for this reason. Make sure the external gas cylinder has enough helium to supply the system with gas throughout the entire run. Sample Insertion. Replace the shipping cap with the quick clamp . Release the load Lock Loosen the gripper of the probe and slowly push the probe towards the cold end. Make sure to push the probe in steps of 75 K so that no thermal shock is offered to the sample or probe. Move only until the mark made by paper clip (\\~34 inch above the tip of the probe). This is the point where the probe is just above the cold head. Changing a sample. Keep in mind that when changing the sample it is imperative to block out as much air from getting into the sample well as possible. Remember you have slightly positive pressure, so this will help keep air out. No warm up of the system is needed during change of sample. Loosen the gripper of the probe and slowly pull the probe towards the hot end. Make sure to pull the probe in steps of 75 K so that no thermal shock is offered to the sample or probe. Once the probe is above the load lock, close the load lock. Use the LS 336 to heat up the coil on the probe to bring it to 300K (only do this after the probe gets to 280K or above). Once the temperature sensor on the probe reads about 300K, open the quick clamp to remove the probe. Replace the quick clamp along with the shipping cap. Shut down. Once the experiment cycle is done or there is a requirement of shutdown for maintenance the following procedure may be followed: Allow the cold head to warm up on its own. Opening the vacuum while the system is still cold will cause it to ice up, potentially damaging the sensors. Once it warms above 200K, you may then open the vacuum,. For faster warm up, you can use the temperature controller to heat the system up to room temperature. If you decide to heat the system up like this, again, make sure the Cryocooler is running at all times. Allow the heat to stabilize for 15 or 20 minutes at room temperature then shut the temperature controller down along with the Cryocooler. Maintain small gas purge on the sample well while the system is warming to room temperature. This will assure that moisture does not collect inside the well. Diagnostic remark Measurement Results One of the very first measurement done was of the RC filter, which was tested using Analog Discovery 2 and the data is as in Fig 28 and one can easily conclude that the RC filter was working as intended at the cut off of 1000Hz at room temperature. It was suspected that the resistor and capacitors might not work reliably at low temperatures (since the resistor is made from thin film of a metal oxide and the capacitor is made of ceramic material). In order to test it, a resistor was mounted on a puck (Fig 29 )and a RT graph was drawn using a PPMS made by Cryogenic Ltd which was present in the lab. The results showed minimal change of resistance at low temperature (160 ohms at below 10 K). Hence the smd resistor worked fine at low temperatures. The cryogenic PPMS didnt have ready method to measure capacitance as a function of temperature. Hence this measurement was only possible after assembling the PCB and mounting it on the probe. This exercise revealed that the capacitance dropped to 10 nF below temperatures of 10 K and an RC plot showed the cut off frequency shift to 100KHz. Nullifying the use case of the RC filter. The bode plot for this trial is in Fig. 30 Finally, one trail to measure the superconducting transition of a 55nm thin-film of Nb was done using the probe. The RT graph of the Nb sample as obtained is as in Fig 31 . From this graph we can conclude that the Tc for the given sample is 7.68 K. An attempt was made to fabricate a Nb| \\(Nb_2O_5\\) |Nb Josephson Junction and to measure the IV graph of the same. The junction was made by taking two strands of Nb wire (50 \\(\\mu\\) M thick ) cleaned with 0.5 molar HCl. One strand was oxidized at 100 degree Celsius for a fixed time, and then the two wires were made to contact each other under tension provided by a stick with sharp edge (Fig 32 ). However not much success was found. Conclusions The probe was successfully fabricated according to the initial design. However many new modifications come into mind after going through the 2 month process. The first major draw back was the failure of the RC filter, which was caused by the SMD capacitor, one can modify the circuit for an inductor instead of capacitor, or one can replace the current SMD capacitor with a different class capacitor. The second draw back was the large thermal mass of the non magnetic base. To counter this, one can reduce the number of samples, thickness of Copper, Increase joint thermal conductivity (by applying thermal paste or indium sheet). Thirdly, the size of the probe is very close to the allowed limits of the system, hence a new design can have a smaller sample holder and adapter. Next, the problem of ease of changing adapter has to be addressed by modifying the entire design . One can also think of replacing the default shielding that the probe comes in with something like silica aerogel for better insulation. One of the major problem faced was that the Helium cylinder gets emptied very quickly, this can be because of helium escaping through the plastic tubing, one can fix this by replacing the tube with cooper piping. Also, PID values for both the heater have to be optimised, the current values of 10,20,10 give a moderately good result. Finally the LabVIEW program can be made more robust, the current program is as basic as it can get, more features such as automation of multiple trials using some form of sequence editor can be thought of.

Scientists around the world use LabVIEW and National Instruments products to design and control instruments. The lab that I currently work in does electrical and magnetic measurements of specific samples at liquid helium temperature (4 K). I wanted to interface all the instruments using LabVIEW. The system I'm using comprises of a Cryostat, Temperature controller, Source meter Unit. The cryostat uses a liquid helium compressor to cool down the chamber where the sample will be kept. The sample is kept on a sample holder that is designed in house, keeping in mind of all the sample space constraints and to maximise the thermal conductivity between cooler and the sample. An image of the sample holder with the sample can be seen here. The sample you see is connected thermally to a heater and a temperature sensor (cernox sensor). Wires from the sample, temperature sensor and the heater come out of the cooler to a breakout box. One can connect any instruments to this break outbox using banana pin wires. Currently, Lakeshore 336 ( LS336 ) temperature controller, B2912A Source meters ( SMU ) are connected in the photo below. A schematic of the setup is I wanted to use LabVIEW to make a program to automate data acquisition of resistance of the sample as a function of sample temperature. In Labview, such software are what are called VI 's which stands for virtual instrument. There are 2 parts to any VI , the front panel, where you put all the user-controllable elements like buttons tet bar etc and logical back panel/ where all the logic for the program is written using \"G\" programming language. To get started with designing such software, typically one needs to install the instrumentation driver and look into example program. Luckily both LS336 and SMU had instrument drivers available. Once installed, one can find example codes by going to HELP > FIND EXAMPLE > and searching the model number. In the case of LS336 , \"Lakeshore 336 Configure heater output control parameters and acquire single reading.vi\" example was just what I needed. It had all the features I wanted to control from that instrument. Heres an image of that vi. Front Panel Back panel Now, however, SMU 's examples didn't work well for me, in such a case, one would make a new VI , right-click on the block diagram and go to The back panel (block diagram) actually contain many sub- VI 's that act as functions so one can use them in their own program. So, in the end, I combined parts from LS336 's example and SMU 's VI tree in a way that is suitable for the current requirement of measuring Resistance as a function of sample temperature. I also added functions to write the obtained data in a systematic format. In the end, this is what was achieved. I would love to show you the block diagram but even 5 different images coudnt capture the entire block diagram (yes it was that messy!) so I have uploaded the source code at the end if anyone wants to take a look at it. One of the better measurements I was able to do with this system was to measure superconducting transition temperature of Nb thin film, a graph of the same is attached here. A preliminary test of Analog Discovery 2! My main objective of using analog discovery( AD ) is to build a vibration sample magnetometer ( VSM ) and use AD2 to source power and acquire measurements. But before I show you how I did that, I can want to show few of the preliminary tests that I did with AD2 , and show you where it succeeds and where it fails. As a part of developing the sample holder for the above project, I designed 20 low pass RC filters. The PCB design and the fabricated PCB images : And in order to test them, I used the bode plot feature of AD2 . The waveforms software that comes up with this device has a tab called Network analyser. The connections to the input and output side of the filter is connected as follows:e the WaveGen 1 output and Oscilloscope Channel 1 input of the device is connected to the filter input, while the Oscilloscope Channel 2 is connected to the filter output, as shown in the picture below. (taken from digilentinc.com) When the instrument is started, the bode plot is shown in the program and it was verified that the RC filters are working with the cutoff at 1KHz just as designed. A screenshot of the program is shown The RC filter was supposed to be used inside the cooler mentioned previously, so it would have to work at 4 K as well. But to our disappointment, at 4 K the cutoff shifted to 100KHz dues to high change in capacitance from 10uF to 12nF it is notable that the smd thin film resistor only changed values from 150ohm at room temperature to 160ohm. So the AD2 was an extremely handy tool. Typical lab network analysers are pretty expensive. Another notable thing is that the AD2 gives unreliable results beyond 1MHz as can be seen in the above image. I also noticed a coupling between Ch1 and CH2 of the oscilloscope, when WaveGen1 and Oscilloscope 1 wires were connected and wave gen was set to generate a random sine wave. This can be seen in the image below. With the same image, one can also notice the significant change in the shape of the sine curve. This only tells me that either WaveGen or Oscilloscope or both cant be used in an environment which requires precision and accuracy. Another image showing the same phenomenon is bellow where a 1Hz frequency was sourced. and in the following image where 17Hz is sourced on a 4 ohm speaker load. Another problem I faced a lot with my particular unit was frequent disconnection from the waveforms software but when checking the list of devices it is present. I suspect that the long cable provided with AD2 has considerable resistance and whenever AD2 draws some significant current through the laptop, the source voltage falls below the threshold and the device disconnects momentarily. This also posed a problem for me. So with all these preliminary tests, I'm unsure of using AD2 to gather data for my research purpose. However ill do the VSM anyway just to see how it goes. I have already wound the 600 turn pickup coil whose signal will be captured by AD2 and the Fe sample is mounted on a 4 ohm speaker which will be driven by AD2 at 17Hz. Im just on the lookout for a suitable electromagnet. Earlier I thought of using AD2 to power a small diameter electromagnet, however, the magnetic field produced by it is around 10 Gauss, which is very small. The VSM would need at least 100 Gauss or above, which may be achieved by and external power supply circuitry whose strength can be controlled by some signal from AD2 . Ill be sure to update this post as soon as I get some update Conclusion The Analog Discovery 2 can very well be called as the Swiss Army Knife of Test Equipments. Everything about it is really well documented and there are video tutorials to get you started too, so it's easy to figure out the whole capabilities of the device. The capabilities easily make this the best tool for learning and testing electronics for hobbyists to experienced. Its an extremely versatile tool to have in your lab shelf. However, this is certainly not a high-performance measurement unit, if you need accurate, precise and more control over the data acquisition or for research purpose, the device is not the go-to choice. LabVIEW is no doubt the industry standard for interfacing instruments, however, its Graphical programming ideology sometimes gets messy and daunting to work with.

Applications Super conducting single photon detector telescope Quantum computer with photons. Levitating high speed trains(~600 km/h) : Transport vehicles such as trains can be made to \"float\" on strong superconducting magnets, virtually eliminating friction between the train and its tracks.This reduces the heat generated and size occupied as compared to regular electromagnet. A landmark for the commercial use of MAGLEV technology occurred in 1990 when it gained the status of a nationally-funded project in Japan. The Minister of Transport authorised construction of the Yamanashi Maglev Test Line which opened on April 3, 1997. In April 2015, the MLX01 test vehicle attained an incredible speed of 603 kph. MRI : By impinging a strong superconductor-derived magnetic field into the body, hydrogen atoms that exist in the body's water and fat molecules are forced to accept energy from the magnetic field. They then release this energy at a frequency that can be detected and displayed graphically by a computer. NMR , SQUID (Superconducting QUantum Interference Device) : SQUID 's are capable of sensing a change in a magnetic field over a billion times weaker than the force that moves the needle on a compass (compass: 5e-5T, SQUID : e-14T.). With this technology, the body can be probed to certain depths without the need for the strong magnetic fields associated with MRI 's. SQUIDS are being used by the U.S. NAVY to detect mines and submarines. High efficiency generators: Electric generators made with superconducting wire are far more efficient than conventional generators wound with copper wire. In fact, their efficiency is above 99% and their size about half that of conventional generators. Essen, Germany has the world's longest superconducting power cable in production at 1 kilometer. It is a 10 kV liquid nitrogen cooled cable. The cable is smaller than an equivalent 110 kV regular cable and the lower voltage has the additional benefit of smaller transformers. Superfluidity of He Zero viscocity Measurement show the 0 resistance to flow of He ie the flow velocity of liquid helium is independent of applied pressure. in semicunductor attraction between \\(e&#94;-\\) in conduction band and holes in valence bond give rise to a bound pairs known as excitons , they also show super fluidity. Because they contain real bound pairs of 2 fermions (in contrast to cooper pais) excitons are bosons. as a result it is possible for them to form a Bose-Einstein condensate, a superfluid that can flow withoutt resistance (this does not give rise to superconductivity as excitons are incharged Why is there superconductivity? tldr: Two electrons form a bound state called Cooper pair. These cooper pairs form a condensate. When an electron is moving through a solid with momentum K, since it also interacts with the lattice, there is an electron phonon interaction, meaning an electron moving through the crystal launches a phonon, another electron flying in a different direction can absorb this photon and form a bound state. These cooper pairs form a condensate (they are all in the same indistinguishable quantum state). And the condensate can be represented by the wave function \\(\\psi=n_s e&#94;{i \\phi}\\) , where \\(n_s\\) is the density of Cooper pair and \\(\\phi\\) denotes the phase. London equations The London equations, developed by brothers Fritz and Heinz London in 1935 relate current to electromagnetic fields in and around a superconductor. In ohms law \\(j=\\sigma E\\) so its differential wrt time is 0, however 1st london equation gives a non 0 relation with \\(j'\\) and \\(E\\) . In leq1, \\(j\\) is the superconducting current density, E and B are respectively the electric and magnetic fields within the superconductor, \\(q\\) is the charge of an electron & proton, m, is electron mass, and \\(n_s\\) , is a phenomenological constant loosely associated with a number density of superconducting carriers. London eqn 1 (le1) also means that particles in a super conductor accelerate when a voltage is applied, in normal metals they only move with drift velocity and 0 acceleration. taking curl on both side of le1 and using Maxwell equations you get the second form of le1. This when integrated over an area, you get the le2. The rationale for the le1 can be thought of in the following different ways: 1) By definition, the electrons in a superconductor flow with no resistance, hence one can imagine electrons as if they were free electrons und er the influence of a uniform external electric field. According to the Lorentz force law \\(F=eE+ev\\mathrm{x}B\\) these electrons should encounter a uniform force, and thus they should in fact accelerate uniformly. This is precisely what the first London equation states. 2) Current density is defined according to the equation \\(j=-n_s e v\\) , Taking this expression from a classical description to a quantum mechanical one, we must replace values j and v by the expectation values of their operators. The velocity operator \\( v = (p+eA)/m\\) is defined by dividing the gauge-invariant, kinematic momentum operator by the particle mass m . we are using as the electron charge. We may then make this replacement in the equation above. However, an important assumption from the microscopic theory of superconductivity ( BCS ) is that the superconducting state of a system is the ground state, and according to a theorem of Bloch's,[ ] in such a state the canonical momentum p is zero. This gives us \\(j=-\\frac{n_s e&#94;2}{m}\\textbf{A}\\) which is loosely the le1 The solution for that differential equation is \\({ \\nabla &#94;{2}\\mathbf {B} ={\\frac {1}{\\lambda &#94;{2}}}\\mathbf {B} ,\\qquad \\lambda \\equiv {\\sqrt {\\frac {m}{\\mu _{0}n_{s}e&#94;{2}}}}.}\\) Superconductivity in the bulk : Cooper pairs electron-phonon interaction leads to an attraction of electrons Cooper pairs: bound states of two electrons with opposite momentum and spin. size of cooper pair is characterised by coherence length $\\xi = \\frac{\\hbar v_F}{\\pi \\Delta} $ electrons greater than this length cant form pairs the net spin is zero so they obey Bose-Einstein statistics: at low T all pairs condense in the lowest state (no Pauli exclusion !) and hence they are Bosons The gap in the diagram is the Superconducting energy gap, X-axis is the energy, 0 is the fremi level. Here, the size of the energy gap indicates the energy gain for two electrons upon formation of a Cooper pair If a conventional superconducting material is cooled from its metallic state (at higher temperatures) into the superconducting state, then the superconducting energy gap is absent above the critical temperature \\(T_{c}\\) , it starts to open upon entering the superconducting state at \\(T_{c}\\) , and it grows upon further cooling. In the \\Delta$ there are only cooper pair condensate and outside there are only unbound electrons. BCS theory predicts that the size \\(\\Delta\\) of the superconducting energy gap for conventional superconductors at zero temperature scales with their critical temperature \\(\\Delta (T=0)=1.764\\,k_{B}T_{c}\\) . The density of states is \\(N_s(E)=N_N(E) E/(E&#94;2- D&#94;2)&#94;{0.5}\\) The super conducting state can be describes with a singel macroscopic wave function \\(\\Psi=\\sqrt(n_s)e&#94;{i \\phi}\\) with \\(n_s\\) is the density of the cooper pairs, \\(\\phi\\) phase of the condensate. So how does the electron pairing occur? consider the crude model: in the above picture, \\(\\omega_D\\) is the Debye relaxation time Spin singlet nature of cooper pairs were confirmed with NMR measurements Ferromagnetic materials are not super conduction since they cant support pairs of electrons with opposite spins (Explained by BCS ) Superconductor terminology The following content on superconductor terminology is largely derived from http://www.superconductors.org/terms.htm with some modifications. Anneal : To heat and then slowly cool a material to reduce brittleness. Annealing of ceramic superconductors usually follows sintering and is done in an oxygen-rich atmosphere to restore oxygen lost during sintering. The oxygen content of a ceramic superconductor is critical. For example, YBCO with 6.4 atoms of oxygen will not superconduct. But YBCO with 6.5 atoms will. Anti-ferromagnetism: A state of matter where adjacent ions in a material are aligned in opposite or \"anti-parallel\" arrays. Such materials display almost no response to an external magnetic field at low temperatures and only a weak attaction at higher temperatures. There is evidence that anti-ferromagnetism in the copper oxides plays a role in the formation of Cooper pairs and, thus, in facilitating a superconductive state in some compounds. BCS Theory : The first widely-accepted theory to explain superconductivity put forth in 1957 by John Bardeen, Leon Cooper, and John Schreiffer. The theory asserts that, as electrons pass through a crystal lattice, the lattice deforms inward towards the electrons generating sound packets known as \"phonons\". These phonons produce a trough of positive charge in the area of deformation that assists subsequent electrons in passing through the same region in a process known as phonon-mediated coupling. This is analogous to rolling a bowling ball up the middle of a bed. 2 people, one lying on each side of the bed, will tend to roll toward the center of the bed, once the ball has created a depression in the mattress. And, a 2nd bowling ball, placed at the foot of the bed, will now, quite easily, roll toward the middle. Borocarbides : Superconducting borocarbides are compounds containing both boron and carbon in combination with rare-earth and transition elements; some of which exhibit the unusual ability to return to a normal, non-superconductive state at temperatures below Tc. BSCCO : An acronym for a ceramic superconductor system containing the elements Bismuth, Strontium, Calcium, Copper and Oxygen. Typically, a small amount of lead is also included in these compounds to promote the highest possible Tc. BSCCO has probably found the widest acceptance among high-Tc superconductor applications due to its unique properties. BSCCO compounds exhibit both an intrinsic Josephson effect and anisotropic (directional) behavior. Ceramics : Ceramic superconductors are inorganic compounds formed by reacting a metal with oxygen, nitrogen, carbon or silicon. The best-known of these are the copper-perovskites. Ceramics are typically hard, brittle, heat-resistant materials formed by a process known as solid-state reaction. Charge Reservoirs: In superconductors, charge reservoirs are the layers that may control the oxidation state of adjacent superconducting planes (even though they themselves are not superconducting). In the layered cuprates, these consist of copper-oxide chains.","tags":"Lecture Notes","url":"https://ashwinschronicles.github.io/Superconductivity","loc":"https://ashwinschronicles.github.io/Superconductivity"},{"title":"git cheat-sheet","text":"Quick Refresher Initial setup Open a terminal/shell and type: $ git config --global user.name \"Your name here\" $ git config --global user.email \"your_email@example.com\" (Don't type the $ ; that just indicates that you're doing this at the command line.) optionally do: $ git config --global color.ui true $ git config --global core.editor nano The first of these will enable coloured output in the terminal; the second tells git that you want to use nano (a user friendly text editor). You can change the highlighted section with your editor of choice! Another way to do this is to edit the .gitconfig file in your home directory. The location of this file depends on the operating system you're using. Set up ssh on your computer. Look to see if you have files ~/.ssh/id_rsa and ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub . If not, create such public/private keys: Open a terminal/shell and type: $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C \"your_email@example.com\" Copy your public key (the contents of the newly-created id_rsa.pub file) into your clipboard. Paste your ssh public key into your github account settings. Go to your github Account Settings Click \" SSH Keys \" on the left. Click \"Add SSH Key\" on the right. Add a label (like \"My laptop\") and paste the public key into the big text box. In a terminal/shell, type the following to test it: $ ssh -T git@github.com If it says something like the following, it worked: Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but Github does not provide shell access. Start a new git repository Your first instinct, when you start to do something new, should be git init . You're starting to write a new paper, you're writing a bit of code to do a computer simulation, you're mucking around with some new data â€¦ anything : think git init . A new repo from scratch Say you've just got some data from a collaborator and are about to start exploring it. Create a directory to contain the project. Go into the new directory. Type git init . Write some code. Type git add to add the files (see the typical use page ). Type git commit . The first file to create (and add and commit) is probably a ReadMe file, either as plain text or with Markdown , describing the project. A new repo from an existing project Say you've got an existing project that you want to start tracking with git. Go into the directory containing the project. Type git init . Type git add to add all of the relevant files. You'll probably want to create a .gitignore file right away, to indicate all of the files you don't want to track. Use git add .gitignore , too. Type git commit . Connect it to github You've now got a local git repository. You can use git locally, like that, if you want. But if you want the thing to have a home on github, do the following. Go to github . Log in to your account. Click the new repository button in the top-right. You'll have an option there to initialize the repository with a README file, but I suggest you don't do it. Click the \"Create repository\" button. Now, follow the second set of instructions shown on the screen, \"Push an existing repositoryâ€¦\" $ git remote add origin git@github.com:username/new_repo $ git push -u origin master Actually, the first line of the instructions will usually say $ git remote add origin https://github.com/username/new_repo But I use git@github.com:username/new_repo rather than https://github.com/username/new_repo , as the former is for use with ssh , if you set up ssh then you won't have to type your password every time you push things to github. If you use the latter construction, you'll have to type your github password every time you push to github. Often used commands Add and commit After you've made some small modifications to your project and checked that they work, use git add to indicate that they're ready. $ git add R/modified.R man/modified.Rd Then use git commit to add the modifications to the repository. $ git commit A text editor (nano if you followed this tutorial) will open; add a short message describing the changes. To abandon your commit, exit the editor without adding text ( ctrl+x in case of nano ). For a one-line commit message, you can just type $ git commit -m \"Fix such and such\" If you want to commit all of the modifications you've made, without having to explicitly \"add\" each file, you can skip the separate add and commit commands and just type $ git commit -a Push to github To push committed changes to github, type $ git push You don't need to do this every time. Do it after you've completed a batch of changes that you're thoroughly happy with and before you move on to something else. Once you've pushed a commit, it's hard to take it away. If you've not pushed it yet, you can go back and scrap it and not have it be part of your project's history. Status You've made some changes to a project, but you're not sure what. Type git status It'll give you a list of files that have been changed, plus new files that haven't been formally added. Diff Exactly what changes have you made? Type git diff Or to see your changes to a particular file, type git diff R/modified.R It'll show you which lines have been added and which have been deleted. .gitignore The various files in your project directory that you're not tracking in git should be indicated in a .gitignore file. You don't have to have a .gitignore file, but if you don't, those files will show up every time you type git status . Each subdirectory can have its own .gitignore file, too. Also, you can have a global such in your home directory; I use ~/.gitignore_global , which contains: *~ .*~ .DS_Store .Rhistory .RData You have to tell git about the global .gitignore file: $ git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global Huge thanks to kbroman.org for his tutorials from where I have collated articles for this cheat sheet. you can check out his page for more detailed workflow.","tags":"Blog","url":"https://ashwinschronicles.github.io/git-cheat-sheet","loc":"https://ashwinschronicles.github.io/git-cheat-sheet"},{"title":"Make a Github Pages blog with Pelican","text":"Github, worlds leading hosting service for Git repositories offers a simple, elegant website solution. It allows its users to store page content in a git repository along with their code. In this blog post ill walk you through the process of setting up a website by combining Pelican with Github Pages. Pelican is a simple python utility that lets you create beautiful weblogs using just text files. In other words its a static-site generator. I have chosen Pelican over other static-site generators as Pelican unlike its counter parts is based on python hence initial setup takes literally no time. Setting up a github.io page To create your Github user page, log in to Github and create a new repositorie username.github.io, as explained on Github pages. (Use your Github username for these repositories.) The username.github.io repository will contain the output HTML files Pelican generates. To add the output directory as a submodule, initialize it with a README file. Installing Pelican We will first create a virtual environment for Pelican via virtualenv before installing Pelican. cd into the directory where you want to install the Pelican website and then run the following command: python -m venv . source bin/activate This essentially creates a virtual python environment where Pelican can be installed and any python package installed here wont affect the global python packages. Once the virtual environment has been created and activated, Pelican can be installed via prefixing with sudo if permissions warrant: pip install pelican markdown typogrify ghp-import shovel cssmin webassets Now clone the source repository you created: git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_USERNAME.github.io.git web-sources Then change directory to the source folder: cd web-sources Because of how Github Pages prefers to work, serving the files from the master branch, you have to put your source code in a new branch, preserving the \"master\" for the output of the static files generated by Pelican. To do that, you must create a new branch called \"source\": git checkout -b source Pelican quickstart Pelican provides an excellent quickstart command. Run it: pelican-quickstart The quickstart will ask you various questions, which you can answer in turn. Before answering them, take a look at my answers below: > Where do you want to create your new web site? [ . ] ./ > What will be the title of this web site?

You might want to open the project folder on your favorite code editor and find the \"content\" folder inside it. Then, create a new file, which can be called my-first-post.md (Just for testing). The contents should begin with the metadata which identifies the Title, Date, Category and more from the post before you start with the content, like this: Title: My first post Date: 2018-1-2 Modified: 2018-1-3 Category: misc Tags: first, misc Slug: My-first-post Authors: Your name Summary: What does your post talk about? Write here. This is the *first post* from my Pelican blog. **YAY!** Let's see how it looks? Go to the terminal, generate the static files and start the server. To do that, use the following command: ( venv ) $ make html && make serve While this command is running, you should be able to visit it on your favorite web browser by typing localhost:8000 on the address bar. A little touch up Now, if you want to put an image in a post, a neat way is to first create a â€˜images' directory inside your content directory, where your posts are. Now, you have to tell Pelican to use it. Find the pelicanconf.py , the file where you configure the system, and add a variable that contains the directory with your images: STATIC_PATHS = [ 'images' ] Save it. Go to your post and add the image this way: ![ Write here a good description for people who can't see the image ]( {filename}/images/IMAGE_NAME.webp ) You can interrupt the server at anytime pressing CTRL +C on the terminal. But you should start it again and check if the image is correct. Can you remember how? ( venv ) $ make html && make serve One last step before your coding is \"done\": you should make sure anyone can read your posts using ATOM or RSS feeds. Find the pelicanconf.py, the file where you configure the system, and edit the part about feed generation: FEED_ALL_ATOM = 'feeds/all.atom.xml' FEED_ALL_RSS = 'feeds/all.rss.xml' AUTHOR_FEED_RSS = 'feeds/ %s .rss.xml' RSS_FEED_SUMMARY_ONLY = False Save everything so you can send the code to Github. You can do that by adding all files, committing it with a message (â€˜first commit') and using git push. You will be asked for your Github login and password. git add -A && git commit -a -m 'first commit' && git push --all As I had said before you would be preserving the master branch for the output of the static files generated by Pelican. Now it's time to generate the mater: $ make github You will be asked for your Github login and password again. Andâ€¦ voilÃ ! Your new blog should be live on https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io. What's next? You generated your first Pelican static website using Markdown and Jinja2. Additional modifications can be made to the Jinja2 templates and the content contained in the Markdown files. Adding .gitignore .gitignore file contains a list of files and folder that git will ignore while syncing with the remote repository. Utilizing .gitignore wisely can reduce the amount of data you need to upload. make a file .gitignore in the web-sources file with the following contents #Custom output pelicanconf_local . py #Python * . py [ cod ] # C extensions * . so # Packages * . egg * . egg - info dist build eggs parts bin var sdist develop - eggs . installed . cfg lib lib64 # Installer logs pip - log . txt # Unit test / coverage reports . coverage . tox nosetests . xml # Translations * . mo # Mr Developer . mr . developer . cfg . project . pydevproject Automate GitHub upload process Create a file up.sh in the web-sources git add -A && git commit -a -m \"\" $1 \" && git push --all Now whenever you want to upload sync the repo just do bash up.sh \"Comment\" Note that the argument \"Comment\" should not contain spaces.

The integer quantization of the Hall conductance was originally predicted by Ando, Matsumoto, and Uemura in 1975, on the basis of an approximate calculation which they themselves did not believe to be true![7] Several researchers subsequently observed the effect in experiments carried out on the inversion layer of MOSFETs. It was only in 1980 that Klaus von Klitzing, working at the high magnetic field laboratory in Grenoble with silicon-based samples developed by Michael Pepper and Gerhard Dorda, made the unexpected discovery that the Hall conductivity was exactly quantized. For this finding, von Klitzing was awarded the 1985 Nobel Prize in Physics. What alerted von Klitzing to the effect was the insensitivity to the fine-tuning of the magnetic field strength. He \"switched on\" the field to apply it to a device through which a fixed current was flowing stabilized by a constant current source, and observed that when things stabilized, a digital voltmeter always showed the same Hall voltage across the sample to many significant figures. (The story is told that he first thought the voltmeter was broken!) Of course, each time the magnetic field was \"turned on\" was different, so the final field would never have been the same on each run of the experiment, and certainly would never have \"accidentally\" taken the precise \"magic value\" of the naive explanation. It is fortunate that von Klitzing switched on the magnetic field with a fixed current through the sample, rather than switched on the current at fixed field, as the coincidence of the unchanged digital voltmeter readings would then never have happened. [4] Theoretical aspects [8,6] The Classical Hall Effect The original, classical Hall effect was discovered in 1879 by Edwin Hall. It is a simple consequence of the motion of charged particles in a magnetic field. The setup for the same is as follows, consider a rectangular bar with thickness, t, Length L, and width W, as shown in Fig 1. Now a constant current along the \\(x\\) axis is passed. When a magnetic field is applied along the \\(z\\) axis ( \\(B_{z}\\) ), the charges in the current experience a force (the Lorentz force). In the absence \\(B_{z}\\) , the charges follow approximately straight paths. However, when \\(B_{z}\\) is applied, their paths get curved, in this way moving charges aggregate on one face of the material. This leaves equal and opposite charges exposed on the other face, where there is a scarcity of mobile charges. The separation of charge establishes an electric field that opposes the migration of further charge, so a steady electric potential is established for as long as the charge is flowing. This is called the Hall voltage \\(V_{H}\\) . The Hall voltage \\(V_{H}\\) can be derived by using the Lorentz force given that, in the steady-state condition, charges are not moving in the y-axis direction. \\(\\vec{{F}}=q(\\vec{E}+\\vec{vx\\vec{B_{z}}})\\) , Now \\(\\vec{F}=0\\implies0=E_{y}-v_{x}B_{z}\\) also \\(E_y=-\\frac{V_H}{w}\\) thus on substituting these values we get : $$\\begin{aligned} V_{H} & = & v_{x}B_{z}w\\end{aligned}$$ This shows that \\(V_{H}\\) is proportional to \\(B_{z}\\) , this result is used in commercial hall sensors which are used to measure magnetic field. However one must note that the result drawn are for the the simple case with no impurities. Otherwise we will have to include the scattering effects. on doing so the previus equation gets modified as $$\\begin{aligned} E_{y} & = & \\frac{-eB\\tau}{m}E_{x}\\end{aligned}$$ where \\(\\tau\\) is called the scattering time. Thus \\(R_{H}\\) called the Hall resistance is defined as $$R_{H}=\\frac{E_{y}}{j_{x}B}=-\\frac{1}{ne}$$ where n is the carrier constant. Thus the measurement of Hall Coefficient gives the following information about the material Carrier concentration , n The sign determines the carriers are holes or electrons. Experimental verification of hall effect.[5] An experiment was performed to measure the charge density of Germanium used as Hall Probe. The experiment was performed under the guidance of Sharvari Kulkarni P. The current passing through sample I, was kept constant at 10mA. The Hall Voltages \\(V_{H}\\) were measured for different values of Magnetic field. For each value of magnetic field, four readings corresponding to different geometric orientations were considered. This is essential due to presence of other thermal and galvanometric transport effects . The data and graphs are as following: Part-1: The value of magnetic field corresponding to particular current was determined and plotted. Two readings corresponding to single current value specifies the values during increment and decrement of current viz. to minimize the error. Part-2: The values of Hall Voltages are measured for different geometrical combinations.The data obtained is as follows - Corresponding graphs are plotted here. From all these graphs, the average value of slope is 0.03218 \\(\\frac{mV}{Gauss}\\) . We have sample current equal to 10mA and sample length as 5mm. Hence the value of Hall Coefficient is 0.1609 \\(\\frac{m&#94;{3}}{C}\\) . Positive sign implies that majority carriers are holes. From this value, the carrier concentration can be calculated as \\(n=3.879x10&#94;{19}m&#94;{-3}\\) Quantum Hall Effects In the previous section we saw details about the Hall effect mainly that Hall Voltage is proportional to the magnetic field. Hall effect is easily observed in room temperature and relatively low magnetic field. If the same setup is now taken down to low temperatures (typically around 1-5 K) and high magnetic field (greater than few Tesla) we see a non linear relation between Hall conductance and Magnetic field. We see some sort of quantization of Hall conductance. The observed resistivity is shown in next figure. [8] On observing the graph and a little bit of theoretical calculations one can deduce the following: Both the Hall resistivity \\(\\rho_{xy}\\) and the longitudinal resistivity \\(\\rho_{xx}\\) exhibit non linear behavior. For lower magnetic field Transverse resistance varies linearly but after certain limit it changes step-like with integer multiples of \\(\\frac{\\hbar}{e&#94;{2}}\\) with some plateau region in between. On these plateau, the resistivity takes the value $$\\rho_{xy}=\\frac{\\hbar}{e&#94;{2}}\\,\\frac{1}{\\nu}\\;\\quad\\nu\\epsilon\\mathbf{Z}$$ The value of \\(\\nu\\) is measured to be an integer to an extraordinary accuracy â€”- something like one part in \\(10&#94;{9}\\) . The quantity \\(\\frac{\\hbar}{e&#94;{2}}\\) is called the quantum of resistivity (with value 25.8128075 k ) The longitudinal resistance has zero value otherwise except at a point where \\(\\rho_{xy}\\) jumps from one plateau to another. The center of each plateau occurs at a point when magnetic field takes a value $$B=\\frac{hn}{\\gamma e}=\\left(\\frac{n}{\\gamma}\\right)\\phi_{0}$$ Where, n is density of states of electrons and \\(\\phi_{0}=\\frac{\\hbar}{e&#94;{2}}\\) as flux quantum. This is a value of Magnetic field at which number of Landau Levels are filled. In order to see the Quantum Hall effect we need to suppress spin-flip scattering of the conduction electrons. Doing this requires us to do two things. The first one is to apply a magnetic field which is large enough to make the Zeeman energy big enough so that the up-spin and down-spin Landau levels do not overlap. Then we also need to make the temperature low enough so that only one of these spin-split Landau levels has a significant thermal occupation. Because the static magnetic fields that we have available to us in the laboratory are only strong enough to give Zeeman energies of order one degree Kelvin, we need to have temperatures of less than one degree Kelvin in order to see the Quantum Hall effect at all. And the lower we can make the temperature, the better the data will look. Classical Explanation[3] One can explain the above phenomenon classically as follows. Consider the standard 2DEG setup with four probes two along x axis and two along y axis similar to the arrangement in Fig1. Ohm's law can be written as \\(J=\\sigma E\\) .Where \\(\\sigma\\) is conductivity of the material. But in presence of Magnetic field B this \\(\\sigma\\) becomes a 2 x 2 tensor matrix. Hence the corresponding resistivity tensor can be written as $$\\begin{aligned} \\sigma&#94;{-1} & = & \\rho\\end{aligned}$$ $$\\begin{pmatrix}\\sigma_{xx} & \\sigma_{xy}\\\\ -\\sigma_{xy} & \\sigma_{yy} \\end{pmatrix}&#94;{-1}=\\begin{pmatrix}\\rho_{xx} & \\rho_{xy}\\\\ -\\rho_{xy} & \\rho_{yy} \\end{pmatrix}$$ \\(\\therefore\\) $$\\sigma_{xx}=\\frac{\\rho_{xx}}{\\rho_{xx}&#94;{2}+\\rho_{xy}&#94;{2}}\\quad and\\quad\\sigma_{xy}=-\\frac{\\rho_{xxy}}{\\rho_{xx}&#94;{2}+\\rho_{xy}&#94;{2}}$$ This brings up the following cases \\(\\sigma_{xx}=0\\) \\(\\implies\\sigma_{xy}=0\\) so \\(\\sigma_{xx}=\\frac{1}{\\rho_{xx}}\\) this is the general solution \\(\\rho_{xy}\\neq0\\) \\(\\implies\\sigma_{xx}\\) and \\(\\sigma_{xy}\\) are non zero. \\(\\rho_{xx}=0\\implies\\sigma_{xx}=0\\) The third case is the one where we see the transition from one plateau to another plateau. This behavior can be explained with Drude's model of metals which considers metals as free electron gas without any interaction between them.So between two collision electron behaves as a free particle. According to the Drude's Model \\(\\sigma_{xx}=\\frac{\\sigma_{0}}{1+\\left(\\tau\\omega_{c}\\right)&#94;{2}}\\) where \\(\\tau\\) is the relaxation time and \\(\\sigma_{0}=\\frac{ne&#94;{2}\\tau}{m}\\) . Thus \\(\\sigma_{xx}=0\\) implies that \\(\\tau\\rightarrow\\infty\\) or in other words, absence of scattering. In this particular case the current is flowing perpendicular to the field, it has the following form. $$\\hat{E}=\\begin{pmatrix}E_{x}\\\\ E_{y} \\end{pmatrix}=\\begin{pmatrix}0 & \\rho_{xy}\\\\ -\\rho_{xy} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}j_{x}\\\\ j_{y} \\end{pmatrix}=\\begin{pmatrix}\\rho_{xy}j_{y}\\\\ -\\rho_{xy}j_{x} \\end{pmatrix}$$ This shows that E and J are perpendicular. Thus \\(\\hat{E}\\cdot\\hat{J}\\) =0. This means that the work done in accelerating the charges is 0. Thus there is a steady current flowing in the sample. And hence no heat dissipation. Hence, \\(\\sigma_{xx}=0\\) means no current is flowing in longitudinal direction and \\(\\rho_{xx}=0\\) means there is no any dissipation of energy. We also see that $$\\sigma_{xy}==\\frac{-1}{\\rho_{xy}}=\\gamma\\frac{e&#94;{2}}{h}\\qquad\\gamma\\rightarrow integer$$ which is the same as the quantised hall value equation. Landau Levels[2] In presence of magnetic field, electrons follow circular trajectories called cyclotron orbits. The charged particles can only occupy orbits with discrete energy values, called Landau levels. The Landau levels are degenerate, with the number of electrons per level directly proportional to the strength of the applied magnetic field. Landau quantization is directly responsible for oscillations in electronic properties of materials as a function of the applied magnetic field. Now lets look at the mathematical derivation of the above statement. Consider our previous model of two-dimensional electron gas system, say with charge q confined to an area A = \\(L_{x}L_{y}\\) in the x-y plane. Let the magnetic field applied be \\(\\hat{B}=B_{z}\\hat{z}\\) . Now the Hamiltonian of such a system will be given by $$\\hat{H}=\\frac{1}{2m}(\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}-q\\hat{\\mathbf{A}}/c)&#94;{2}$$ where \\(\\hat{p}\\) is the canonical momentum operator and \\(\\hat{A}\\) is the electromagnetic vector potential. There is some gauge freedom in the choice of vector potential for a given magnetic field which means that adding the gradient of a scalar field to \\(\\hat{A}\\) changes the overall phase of the wave function by an amount corresponding to the scalar field. But physical properties are not influenced by the specific choice of gauge. For simplicity in calculation, lets choose the Landau gauge, which is $${\\displaystyle \\hat{\\mathbf{A}}=\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\ B_{z}x\\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}.}$$ $${\\displaystyle \\hat{H}=\\frac{\\hat{p}_{x}&#94;{2}}{2m}+\\frac{1}{2m}\\left(\\hat{p}_{y}-\\frac{qB\\hat{x}}{c}\\right)&#94;{2}}$$ The operator \\(\\hat{p}_{y}\\) commutes with this Hamiltonian, since the operator \\(\\hat{y}\\) is absent by the choice of gauge. Thus the operator \\(\\hat{p}_{y}\\) can be replaced by its eigenvalue \\(k_{y}\\) . The Hamiltonian can also be written more simply by noting that the cyclotron frequency is \\(\\omega_{c}=\\frac{qB}{mc}\\) , giving $$\\hat{H}=\\frac{\\hat{p}_{x}&#94;{2}}{2m}+\\frac{1}{2}m\\omega_{c}&#94;{2}\\left(\\hat{x}-\\frac{\\hbar k_{y}}{m\\omega_{c}}\\right)&#94;{2}$$ . This is the Hamiltonian one would encounter for the quantum harmonic oscillator problem as well, except with the minimum of the potential shifted in coordinate space by $$x_{0}=\\frac{k_{y}}{m\\omega_c}$$ . To find the energies, note that translating the harmonic oscillator potential does not affect the energies. The energies of this system are thus identical to those of the standard quantum harmonic oscillator, $$E_{n}=\\hbar\\omega_{c}\\left(n+\\frac{1}{2}\\right),\\quad n\\geq0$$ . The energy does not depend on the quantum number \\(k_{y}\\) , so there will be degeneracy. With this argument we can conclude that the state of the electron can uniquely determined by two by two quantum numbers, n and \\(k_{y}\\) . Now let us focus on the degeneracy of Landau level. Degeneracy of Landau levels[6,2] Each set of wave functions with the same value of n is called a Landau level. Effects of Landau levels are only observed when the mean thermal energy is smaller than the energy level separation, \\(kT << \\hbar \\omega_c\\) , meaning low temperatures and strong magnetic fields. Each Landau level is degenerate because of the second quantum number \\(k_{y}\\) , which can take the values \\({\\displaystyle k_{y}={\\frac{2\\pi N}{L_{y}}}}\\) , where N is an integer. The allowed values of N are further restricted by the condition that the center of force of the oscillator, \\(x_{0}\\) , must physically lie within the system, \\(0\\le x0<L_{x}\\) . This gives the following range for N, $${\\displaystyle 0\\leq N<{\\frac{m\\omega_{c}L_{x}L_{y}}{2\\pi\\hbar}}.}$$ For particles with charge \\(q=Ze\\) , the upper bound on N can be simply written as a ratio of fluxes, $${\\displaystyle {\\frac{ZBL_{x}L_{y}}{(hc/e)}}=Z{\\frac{\\Phi}{\\Phi_{0}}},}$$ where \\(\\Phi_{0}=hc/e\\) is the fundamental quantum of flux and \\(\\Phi=BA\\) is the flux through the system (with area \\(A=L_{x}L_{y}\\) ). Thus, for particles with spin S, the maximum number D of particles per Landau level is $${\\displaystyle D=Z(2S+1){\\frac{\\Phi}{\\Phi_{0}}}~}$$ Edge modes[4] So far we have discussed the ideal 2DEG scenario. The real samples, though comparatively clean, do not have the transnational invariance that makes each state in a given Landau level have exactly the same energy. Hence there is some sort of broadening of the Landau level. So what is the explanation in this case ? The initial attempts to explain the effect focused on this effect of disorder, and found that, while two-dimensional electron systems with disorder generally have localized states, this is modified in a magnetic field. Here, the centers of the Landau orbits slowly precess (in opposite senses) around either local minima or local maxima of the potential, corresponding to localized states, but there is an energy at the center of the broadened Landau level at which the centers of the orbits move along open snakelike paths, and the states at that energy are extended as opposed to localized. These edge states act as skipping orbits that precess around the boundary of the system in the opposite sense to that of the Landau orbits, when a particle in a Landau orbit intersects the boundary, and bounces off it.

Web page controlled LED strip using NodeMCU connected on a local network. Outline: Web page controlled LED strip is like the \"Hello world\" of IoT. In this post I will be detailing on the procedure I followed to set it up. The schematic of the project will be as follows: So when we click a button on a web browser we can turn the led strip on or off using a relay which we control using the ESP8266 board. Materials: NodeMCU 5v Relay LED strip LED strip power supply (any generic 12V power supply) Installing NodeMCU Board Package in Arduino IDE : Open up Arduino IDE . Go to Files-> Preferences. Enter http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json into Additional Board Manager URLs field. Now go to Tools->Boards->Board Manager, and search for ESP8266 and install the package. If you have the same board as me (NodeMCU Amica) then you will have to install drivers for CP2102 ( USB to Serial Converter) [Note: some board come with CH340G chip in which case you dont need to follow this step.] Download drivers from here and install it. Connect the nodeMCU to your computer and install the downloaded drives when your system prompts to install the drivers for the newly connected USB device.Go to the device manager of your computer and note down the COM port allocated to the newly connected USB device. Pin Connections: Connect NodeMCU Ground ( GND ) pin to -ve pin of Relay . Connect NodeMCU Supply ( Vin) pin to +ve pin of Relay . Connect NodeMCU Digital pin ( D0 ) to Input pin of Relay . Coding Part The code for the nodeMCU that I have uploaded is here . Replace the line WiFi.softAP(\"Hello_IoT\", \"ashwins12345678\"); with whatever SSID and password you want to put. NOTE . This sketch uses WiFi . softAP instead of the commonly used WiFi . begin , the reason is that when I use WiFi . begin () I can ' t find the SSID when I do WiFi scan, however, the SSID I do see is of the previous sketch where I used WiFi.softAP(). If you encounter the same problem while using WiFi.begin then using my code should fix it. When u have successfully built your connection and the code, you have to upload the code into the NodeMCU by using a micro USB . Now, go to Tools > Board > ESP8266 Modules and you can see many options for ESP8266 . Select \"NodeMCU 1.0 ( ESP -12E Module). Next, select your port ( the same one you saw in the device manager previously ). If you cant recognize your port, go to the Control Panel > System > Device Manager > Port and update your USB driver. Now upload the code to the board. Finale testing: Now open up your Serial Monitor, and note down the URL . Now put the URL in your phone's browser( it usually defaults to 192.168.4.1). A page will open having two buttons ON and OFF . If everything is correct when you press ON the LED will light up and when you press OFF the LED will turn off. Final Connections: Now that we know our code and setup works let's connect the relay to the led strip power source as shown in the figure in the outline section. Vola! there's our first project! Whats next? We can add more feature to the project such as making it connect to a wifi router so that you can access the LED strip from anywhere in the world. We can convert this project to use the barebone ESP8266 and FTDI programmer. We can use the power supply of the LED strip to power the ESP8266 (Not recommended since most LED power supply have high AC noise as I found out in my case and hence can damage the ESP8266 board).Add more devices for the ESP to control and much much more!

It was originally posted here as a part of element14's RoadTest. I thank element14 for sending me the review unit. Evaluation Type: Independent Products Was everything in the box required?: Yes Comparable Products/Other parts you considered: Arduino due , Raspberry Pi What were the biggest problems encountered?: When arduino ide is running, other programs such as Labview cant programme the mega.This is true in general of all arduino device.The only solution i found was to close arduino ide , log off and then log back in. Detailed Review: Arduino Mega the big brother of Arduino Uno has 54 digital I/O pins, 16 analogue inputs. That's a whopping difference of 40 digital and 10 analogue pins.the closest to it in the Arduino family is the Arduino Due. Arduino mega is generally used for projects that require a high number of I/O and memory thus they are commonly found in 3D printers and robotics projects. LabView is a system-design platform that allows you to visually write a program.It is generally used by engineers and scientists to create programs to automate the process of data acquisition from lab instruments. In this review, i try to Arduino mega to interface between the LabVIEW software and an instrument. ## Part 1: Installing LabVIEW and NI - VISA . Go to www.ni.com/trylabview Click on Download LabVIEW. Right-Click and then run LabVIEW Setup as administrator. Follow the instructions and wait for the installation to finish Note: You might get an error while installing Click on decline support as you do not have any device drivers. We have to download driver later. LabVIEW 2017 is successfully installed. Restart system later if prompted for a restart. To download NI - VISA driver for serial communication go to https://www.ni.com/visa/ and download the appropriate version of the software, Install it in the same way as before. Labview has so many addons both by a 3rd party and NI itself that by default the software comes with a few basic tool set. This set can be expanded by installing add-ons, we shall now look into the process of installing the Arduino interfacing addon. Open the VI Package Manager and wait for it to download all the repository (this could take several minutes depending on your bandwidth) Search for \"Arduino\" in the search bar. Install Digilent LINX and \"LabVIEW Interface for Arduino\". Once the installation is done without any errors you should Notice an \"installed\" symbol to the left of Digilent LINX toolbox, click finish. In order to verify if all softwares are installed correctly, Open LabVIEW.Click on File > New VI . On one the panels, click on Window > Tile Left and Right. Right-click on the block diagram, scroll down to see that Arduino (LabView interface for Arduino: LIFA ) and LINX is installed. ### Uploading LabView Interface for Arduino Firmware In order to interface Arduino with the LabView, we need to upload a sketch that acts as a firmware. For that make sure that you have Arduino ide already installed Open the arduino ide and upload the sketch that has the path: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\ National Instruments\\ LabVIEW 2017\\ vi.lib\\ LabVIEW Interface for Arduino\\ Firmware\\ LIFA_Base\\ LIFA_Base.ino (adjust the path based on the installation location of the LabView) Check for Board type and COM Port under Tools menu NOTE : Do not upload any code to Arduino Board hereafter. Arduino Board with LIFA_Base firmware is now ready to be used with LabVIEW 2017. ## PART 2: Interfacing and Controlling an LED using LabVIEW, Arduino and LIFA The hello world equivalent in Arduino is an LED blink sketch, let us look at the implementation of led blink in LabView. Every program in LabVIEW is called a VI it ends with an extension dot VI click. On creating a new project in Labview you will see two windows opening the first one has a front panel and the second one is the block diagram the front panel will usually house all kinds of numeric controls knobs dials meters gauge boolean buttons LED graphs charts indicators and the block diagram will have all programming tools structures numeric functions like addition subtraction boolean functions etc. now what we have to start with is right click on the block diagram scroll down to Arduino. For this particular program, we need four major functions to control led. Initialization, Set digital pin mode (analogous to pinMode), digital write and Close. to know what each of these functions does or what each of these blocks does click on it and press on the question mark on the right corner which is called as context help context help will explain what each of these blocks does and what has to be connected to each of these terminals. For example, in initialization, the first option is visa resource that is where you specify which communication port your Arduino is connected to say COM4 port for example second, you specify the baud rate (whatever is in the bracket is by default so you don't have to specify it again) Board type would be Mega. Now let us think about the flow of the program, first the led will be initialised as output then its is set high and then the loop continues till an event triggers the end. We represent the flow of the program in LabView in the same way. The following would be the possible connection in the flow. Error out pin of initialisation module is wired in series to an error in pin of digital pin mode and digital write and finally the close module. The same arrangement is made with Arduino resource pin of each module. the pin number is set by creating a constant at the io pin of the pinmode module and setting its value to 13 and output.The value of 0 1 at the value point in digital write module is equivalent to the High and Low mode. Now to set the loop right click go to programming > structure find the while loop module and draw a square around the digitalwrite module (the one we want to repeat). set the constitutional terminal to a boolean control such as a button in the front end editor. Now the program is complete. Click on run program. This exercise demonstrates how Arduino can be used to interface a device(an led in this case) using Labview.
