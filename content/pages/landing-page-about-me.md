Thanks for joining me!

I am Ashwin Kumar K, a Dual Major (B.E Electronics and Instrumentation & Int. MSc Physics) student at BITS Pilani KK Birla Goa campus (Batch of 2017)

I had always wanted to publish some of my projects and experiments on a public platform so that people working on similar projects can give and take ideas. It also serves as a way to showcase the experience that I have gained while doing such projects.

I intend to post details of projects or experiments that I have performed  mostly in the field of Science and Engineering as I complete them on this web-page.

Take a trip down my memory lane. I hope to see you around!

Here is my CV  :
