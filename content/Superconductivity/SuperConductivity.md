Summary: Short note on superconductivity

# Properties

- Discoverd first in Hg at 4.2K in Liquid Helium
- Super current induced in a ring follows $$ I(t)=I_0e^{(-t/\tau))}$$ and dosent change much for over 100,000 years for SC and goes to 1% of initial value in few nano secondsin a normal metal.
- Magnetic field destroy super conductivity (so does current in the SC)

- Magnetic Impurities lower $T_C$ (non mag has no effect)

- Fe Co Ni nonSC
- CU Ag Au nonSC

- Si becomes SC at high Pressure
- Conventional and unconventional SC
- most unconventional SC has C,O atoms in  pervoskite structure.

- *Meissner effect* is perfect expulsion of Magnetic field out of SC (except penetration depth) due to screening current![](..\images\misener.png)
- SC act as perfect diamagnet $\chi=-1$ and is a defining feature of SC and not just $\rho$=0
- Heat capacity of a SC is dicontinuous at $T_C$ and crashes to 0 after  $T_C$

- the function is given by $C \alpha e^{a/T}$

## Applications
- Super conducting single photon detector telescope![](..\images\photondetector.png)
- Quantum computer with photons.
- Levitating high speed trains(~600 km/h).
-MRI,NMR,SQUID
-High efficiency generators

- *Fun fact:* Essen, Germany has the world's longest superconducting power cable in production at 1 kilometer. It is a 10 kV liquid nitrogen cooled cable. The cable is smaller than an equivalent 110 kV regular cable and the lower voltage has the additional benefit of smaller transformers.
