	abstract = {This review discusses the electronic properties and the prospective research directions of superconductor-graphene heterostructures. The basic electronic properties of graphene are introduced to highlight the unique possibility of combining two seemingly unrelated physics, superconductivity and relativity. We then focus on graphene-based Josephson junctions, one of the most versatile superconducting quantum devices. The various theoretical methods that have been developed to describe graphene Josephson junctions are examined, together with their advantages and limitations, followed by a discussion on the advances in device fabrication and the relevant length scales. The phase-sensitive properties and phase-particle dynamics of graphene Josephson junctions are examined to provide an understanding of the underlying mechanisms of Josephson coupling via graphene. Thereafter, microscopic transport of correlated quasiparticles produced by Andreev reflections at superconducting interfaces and their phase-coherent behaviors are discussed. Quantum phase transitions studied with graphene as an electrostatically tunable 2D platform are reviewed. The interplay between proximity-induced superconductivity and the quantum-Hall phase is discussed as a possible route to study topological superconductivity and non-Abelian physics. Finally, a brief summary on the prospective future research directions is given.},

@article{bi2se3,
	abstract = {The transmission of Cooper pairs between two weakly coupled superconductors produces a superfluid current and a phase difference; the celebrated Josephson effect. Because of time-reversal and parity symmetries, there is no Josephson current without a phase difference between two superconductors. Reciprocally, when those two symmetries are broken, an anomalous supercurrent can exist in the absence of phase bias or, equivalently, an anomalous phase shift \ensuremath{\varphi}0 can exist in the absence of a superfluid current. We report on the observation of an anomalous phase shift \ensuremath{\varphi}0 in hybrid Josephson junctions fabricated with the topological insulator Bi2Se3 submitted to an in-plane magnetic field. This anomalous phase shift \ensuremath{\varphi}0 is observed directly through measurements of the current-phase relationship in a Josephson interferometer. This result provides a direct measurement of the spin-orbit coupling strength and open new possibilities for phase-controlled Josephson devices made from materials with strong spin-orbit coupling. An anomalous phase shift in a topological insulator based Josephson junction is expected but never been observed. Here, Assouline et al. observe an anomalous phase shift in a Bi2Se3 based Josephson junction in presence of an in-plane magnetic field, opening opportunities for phase-controlled Josephson devices.},

@report{sfs-2ndharmonics,
	abstract = {We report the observation of a current-phase relation dominated by the second Josephson harmonic in superconductor-ferromagnet-superconductor junctions. The exotic current-phase relation is realized in the vicinity of a temperature-controlled 0-to-\ensuremath{\pi} junction transition, at which the first Josephson harmonic vanishes. Direct current-phase relation measurements, as well as Josephson interferometry, non-vanishing supercurrent and half-integer Shapiro steps at the 0-\ensuremath{\pi} transition self-consistently point to an intrinsic second harmonic term, making it possible to rule out common alternative origins of half-periodic behavior. While surprising for diffusive multimode junctions, the large second harmonic is in agreement with theory predictions for thin ferromagnetic interlayers. The sinusoidal dependence of supercurrent on the phase difference across the junction \ensuremath{\varphi} was originally derived for superconductor-insulator-superconductor junctions , but has for a long time been used to describe most of the experimentally realized junctions [1]. Advances in materials science and nanofabrication have lead to the observation of a large variety of current-phase relations (CPRs) [2]. For example, \ensuremath{\pi}-junctions may still have a sinusoidal CPR but with a phase shift of \ensuremath{\pi} [3-6]. \ensuremath{\varphi} 0-junctions violate time-reversal symmetry with a phase shift \ensuremath{\varphi} 0 other than 0 or \ensuremath{\pi} in the CPR, meaning that their current-phase relations have no phase-inversion symmetry [7, 8]. Narrow and/or ballistic weak links with non-sinusoidal current-phase relations, i.e. containing higher sine components, have been reported based on a variety of materials [9-13]. Finally, fractional current-phase relations such as sin(\ensuremath{\varphi}/2) are being searched for in topo-logical superconductor junctions [14-16]. These developments motivate new studies of exotic CPR. This paper is focused on a junction with a rare second harmonic current-phase relation dominated by the sin(2\ensuremath{\varphi}) contribution. In contrast with previous studies of higher Josephson components, the junction barrier is a diffusive metal with a macroscopic number of modes. The second harmonic CPR is realized in the vicinity of a temperature-controlled 0-\ensuremath{\pi} transition of a superconductor-ferromagnet-superconductor (SFS) junction. At the transition temperature T \ensuremath{\pi} the amplitude of the first order sin(\ensuremath{\varphi}) term goes through zero in order to change sign. If a significant higher-order term is present it can become the leading one [17]. Earlier studies of the 0-\ensuremath{\pi} transition in various junctions have suggested a second-order CPR [5, 18, 19], however those experiments could not rule out alternative explanations for \ensuremath{\pi}-periodic behavior such as due to more than one junction in the loop, disorder in the junction or driven phase dynamics [20]. FIG. 1. (a) Optical micrograph of a prototype device, zoomed in on the area containing the trilayer SFS junction, as well as the small shunt inductor L. Red frame corresponds to the area in panel (c). (b) schematic of the CPR measurement. Dashed line indicates that both inductors are later cut to perform current-voltage measurements on the SFS junction. (c) scanning electron micrograph of the measured device, focused on the region marked by red in panel (a) after the inductor L is cut with a focused ion beam. Here we perform four distinct measurements on a single SFS junction, all four indicating a dominant and intrinsic second-order Josephson effect. First, a direct measurement of the current-phase relation is performed by embedding a single SFS junction into a superconduct},

@article{InAs-Phasebattery,
	abstract = {A classical battery converts chemical energy into a persistent voltage bias that can power electronic circuits. Similarly, a phase battery is a quantum device that provides a persistent phase bias to the wave function of a quantum circuit. It represents a key element for quantum technologies based on phase coherence. Here we demonstrate a phase battery in a hybrid superconducting circuit. It consists of an n-doped InAs nanowire with unpaired-spin surface states, that is proximitized by Al superconducting leads. We find that the ferromagnetic polarization of the unpaired-spin states is efficiently converted into a persistent phase bias \ensuremath{\varphi} 0 across the wire, leading to the anomalous Josephson effect 1,2. We apply an external in-plane magnetic field and, thereby, achieve continuous tuning of \ensuremath{\varphi} 0. Hence, we can charge and discharge the quantum phase battery. The observed symmetries of the anomalous Josephson effect in the vectorial magnetic field are in agreement with our theoretical model. Our results demonstrate how the combined action of spin-orbit coupling and exchange interaction induces a strong coupling between charge, spin and superconducting phase, able to break the phase rigidity of the system. At the base of phase-coherent superconducting circuits is the Josephson effect 3 : a quantum phenomenon describing the flow of a dissipationless current in weak links between two superconduc-tors. The Josephson current I J is then intimately connected to the macroscopic phase difference \ensuremath{\varphi} between the two superconduc-tors via the so-called current-phase relationship (CPR) I J (\ensuremath{\varphi}). If either time-reversal (t {\textrightarrow} −t) or inversion (r ! ! � r ! I) symmetries are preserved, I J (\ensuremath{\varphi}) is an odd function of \ensuremath{\varphi} and the CPR, in its simplest form, reads I J {\d h}\ensuremath{\varphi}{\TH} {\textonequarter} I C sin{\d h}\ensuremath{\varphi}{\TH} I (ref. 4), with I C being the junction critical current. This means that, as long as one of these symmetries is preserved, an open Josephson junction (JJ; I J = 0) cannot provide a phase bias or, accordingly, a JJ closed on a superconducting circuit (\ensuremath{\varphi} = 0) cannot generate current. As a consequence, the implementation of a phase battery 5 is prevented by these symmetry constraints, which impose a rigidity on the superconducting phase, a universal constraint valid for any quantum phase 6,7. The break of time-reversal symmetry (alone) maintains the phase rigidity but enables two possible phase shifts, 0 or \ensuremath{\pi}, in the CPR. The 0-\ensuremath{\pi} transition has been extensively studied in superconductor/ ferromagnet/superconductor junctions 4,8 , which has applications in cryogenic memories 9,10. On the other hand, if both time-reversal and inversion symmetries are broken, a finite phase shift 0 < \ensuremath{\varphi} 0 < \ensuremath{\pi} can be induced 2,11 and the CPR reads as follows:},

The obtained results yield in concept of qubit logic operations accomplished by means of magnetic field application. One can propose a set of the qubits, each designed for specific logic operation. The qubit logic specialization may be fixed by both the junction current-phase relation and the characteristic Josephson-to-Coulomb energy ratio s. As current-phase relation is assigned, the qubit specialization can be tuned by the ratio s which varies with Josephson junction area. Examples of some logic operations are considered. Estimation of both the decoherence time and the quality factor Q has been obtained for such a qubit based on high-Tc superconductors, which could provide the required current-phase relation.},
