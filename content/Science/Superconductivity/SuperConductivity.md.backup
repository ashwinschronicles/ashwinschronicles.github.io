Summary: Short note on superconductivity

This post is my notes on Superconductivity from video lectures of [Sergey Frolov](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDBKb7qMyNXujTf7kKRdstg "Youtube Link")on Solid State Ph.ysics
 

# Properties

- Discoverd first in Hg at 4.2K in Liquid Helium
- Super current induced in a ring follows $$ I(t)=I_0e^{(-t/\tau))}$$ and dosent change much for over 100,000 years for SC and goes to 1% of initial value in few nano secondsin a normal metal.
- Magnetic field destroy super conductivity (so does current in the SC)

- Magnetic Impurities lower $T_C$ (non mag has no effect)

- Fe Co Ni nonSC
- CU Ag Au nonSC
- ![image](../../images/sup_ele.png)
- Si becomes SC at high Pressure
- Conventional and unconventional SC
- most unconventional SC has C,O atoms in  pervoskite structure.
-  ![image](../../images/SC_graph.png)
- *Meissner effect* is perfect expulsion of Magnetic field out of SC (except penetration depth) due to screening current![image](../../images/misener.png)
- SC act as perfect diamagnet $\chi=-1$ and is a defining feature of SC and not just $\rho$=0

- Difference between perfect conductor and SC ![Difference between perfect conductor and SC](../../images/SUP_perfCandSC.png)

- The esseence of meissner effect is that SC **alaways expels the magnetic field**

- Heat capacity of a SC is dicontinuous at $T_C$ and crashes to 0 after  $T_C$

- The function is given by $C \alpha e^{a/T}$ and is simmilar to Einstein's model of specific heat, n coupled osscilator model. 
- Exponets offten go with gaps (semiconductor and superconductor state)
- In the super conducting state, there is a samll energy gap arround the fermi level. With $E_g~10x^{-4}E_F$

- one in 10,000 electrons participate in SC state.
- The a in $C \alpha e^{a/T}$ is given by $-E_g/2$
- Higher $E_g$ implies higher $T_C$

- Nb has the higest gap of all the materials.

## Applications

- Super conducting single photon detector telescope![image](../../images/photondetector.png)
- Quantum computer with photons.
- Levitating high speed trains(~600 km/h).
-MRI,NMR,SQUID
-High efficiency generators

- *Fun fact:* Essen, Germany has the world's longest superconducting power cable in production at 1 kilometer. It is a 10 kV liquid nitrogen cooled cable. The cable is smaller than an equivalent 110 kV regular cable and the lower voltage has the additional benefit of smaller transformers.

# Superfluidity of He

- Zero viscocity

- Measurement show the 0 resistance to flow of He 
- ie the flow velocity of liquid helium is independent of applied pressure.
- in semicunductor attraction between $e^-$ in conduction band and holes in valence bond give rise to a bound pairs known as excitons , they also show super fluidity.![superfluidity](../../images/exciton.png)

- Because they contain real bound pairs of 2 fermions (in contrast to cooper pais) excitons are bosons.
- as a result it is possible for them to form a Bose-Einstein condensate, a superfluid that can flow withoutt resistance
- (this does not give rise to superconductivity as excitons are incharged

# Why is there superconductivity?
tldr: Two electrons form a bound state called Cooper pair. These cooper pairs form a condensate.
![cooperpairs](../../images/cooperpairs.png)

When an electron is moving through a solid with momentum K, since it also interacts with the latice, there is an electron phonon interaction, meaning an electron mvoing th rough the crystal launches a phonon, another electron flying in a different direction can absorb this photon and forma bound state. These cooper pairs form a condensate (they are all in the same indistinguisahable quantum state). And the condensate can be represented by the wave function $\psi=n_s E^{i \phi}$, where $n_s$ is the density of Cooper pair and $\phi$ deontes the phase.
