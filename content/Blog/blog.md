#Make a Github Pages blog with Pelican
Github, worlds leading  hosting service for Git repositories  offers a simple, elegant website solution. It allows its users to  store page content in a git repository along with their code.

In this blog post ill walk you through the process of setting up a website by combining Pelican with Github Pages. Pelican is a simple python utility that lets you create beautiful weblogs using just text files. In other words its a static-site generator. I have chosen Pelican over other static-site generators as Pelican unlike its counter parts is based on python hence initial  setup takes literally no time.
