Summary: In which the author writes their first blog post.

Thanks for joining me!

I am Ashwin Kumar K, a Dual Degree BE â€“ Int. MSc Physics at BITS Pilani KK Birla Goa campus (Batch of 2017).

This is the first post of this site where I intend to post some of my works related to the field of Science and Engineering.

I had always wanted to publish some of my projects and experiments on a public platform so that people working on similar projects can give and take ideas. It also serves as a way to showcase the experience that I have gained while doing such projects.

I intend to post details of projects or experiments that I have performed mostly in the field of Science and Engineering as I complete them.

Take a trip down my memory lane. I hope to see you around!
