It was originally posted here as a part of element14's RoadTest. I thank element14 for sending me the review unit. Evaluation Type: Test Equipment Was everything in the box required?: Yes Comparable Products/Other parts you considered: ADALM1000 ,SainSmart DDS140 ,Hantek iDSO 1070A,Link Instruments MSO -28 What were the biggest problems encountered?: Low power supply capability, coupling between Ch1 and Ch2 of the oscilloscope, it has bandwidth limitations and voltage input limitation, the device gets disconnected often(probably faulty cable) Detailed Review: Typical Use case of LabVIEW in research labs Scientists around the world use LabVIEW and National Instruments products to design and control instruments. The lab that I currently work in does electrical and magnetic measurements of specific samples at liquid helium temperature (4 K). I wanted to interface all the instruments using LabVIEW. The system I'm using comprises of a Cryostat, Temperature controller, Source meter Unit. The cryostat uses a liquid helium compressor to cool down the chamber where the sample will be kept. The sample is kept on a sample holder that is designed in house, keeping in mind of all the sample space constraints and to maximise the thermal conductivity between cooler and the sample. An image of the sample holder with the sample can be seen here. The sample you see is connected thermally to a heater and a temperature sensor (cernox sensor). Wires from the sample, temperature sensor and the heater come out of the cooler to a breakout box. One can connect any instruments to this break outbox using banana pin wires. Currently, Lakeshore 336 ( LS336 ) temperature controller, B2912A Source meters ( SMU ) are connected in the photo below. A schematic of the setup is I wanted to use LabVIEW to make a program to automate data acquisition of resistance of the sample as a function of sample temperature. In Labview, such software are what are called VI 's which stands for virtual instrument. There are 2 parts to any VI , the front panel, where you put all the user-controllable elements like buttons tet bar etc and logical back panel/ where all the logic for the program is written using \"G\" programming language. To get started with designing such software, typically one needs to install the instrumentation driver and look into example program. Luckily both LS336 and SMU had instrument drivers available. Once installed, one can find example codes by going to HELP > FIND EXAMPLE > and searching the model number. In the case of LS336 , \"Lakeshore 336 Configure heater output control parameters and acquire single reading.vi\" example was just what I needed. It had all the features I wanted to control from that instrument. Heres an image of that vi. Front Panel Back panel Now, however, SMU 's examples didn't work well for me, in such a case, one would make a new VI , right-click on the block diagram and go to The back panel (block diagram) actually contain many sub- VI 's that act as functions so one can use them in their own program. So, in the end, I combined parts from LS336 's example and SMU 's VI tree in a way that is suitable for the current requirement of measuring Resistance as a function of sample temperature. I also added functions to write the obtained data in a systematic format. In the end, this is what was achieved. I would love to show you the block diagram but even 5 different images coudnt capture the entire block diagram (yes it was that messy!) so I have uploaded the source code at the end if anyone wants to take a look at it. One of the better measurements I was able to do with this system was to measure superconducting transition temperature of Nb thin film, a graph of the same is attached here. A preliminary test of Analog Discovery 2! My main objective of using analog discovery( AD ) is to build a vibration sample magnetometer ( VSM ) and use AD2 to source power and acquire measurements. But before I show you how I did that, I can want to show few of the preliminary tests that I did with AD2 , and show you where it succeeds and where it fails. As a part of developing the sample holder for the above project, I designed 20 low pass RC filters. The PCB design and the fabricated PCB images : And in order to test them, I used the bode plot feature of AD2 . The waveforms software that comes up with this device has a tab called Network analyser. The connections to the input and output side of the filter is connected as follows:e the WaveGen 1 output and Oscilloscope Channel 1 input of the device is connected to the filter input, while the Oscilloscope Channel 2 is connected to the filter output, as shown in the picture below. (taken from digilentinc.com) When the instrument is started, the bode plot is shown in the program and it was verified that the RC filters are working with the cutoff at 1KHz just as designed. A screenshot of the program is shown The RC filter was supposed to be used inside the cooler mentioned previously, so it would have to work at 4 K as well. But to our disappointment, at 4 K the cutoff shifted to 100KHz dues to high change in capacitance from 10uF to 12nF it is notable that the smd thin film resistor only changed values from 150ohm at room temperature to 160ohm. So the AD2 was an extremely handy tool. Typical lab network analysers are pretty expensive. Another notable thing is that the AD2 gives unreliable results beyond 1MHz as can be seen in the above image. I also noticed a coupling between Ch1 and CH2 of the oscilloscope, when WaveGen1 and Oscilloscope 1 wires were connected and wave gen was set to generate a random sine wave. This can be seen in the image below. With the same image, one can also notice the significant change in the shape of the sine curve. This only tells me that either WaveGen or Oscilloscope or both cant be used in an environment which requires precision and accuracy. Another image showing the same phenomenon is bellow where a 1Hz frequency was sourced. and in the following image where 17Hz is sourced on a 4 ohm speaker load. Another problem I faced a lot with my particular unit was frequent disconnection from the waveforms software but when checking the list of devices it is present. I suspect that the long cable provided with AD2 has considerable resistance and whenever AD2 draws some significant current through the laptop, the source voltage falls below the threshold and the device disconnects momentarily. This also posed a problem for me. So with all these preliminary tests, I'm unsure of using AD2 to gather data for my research purpose. However ill do the VSM anyway just to see how it goes. I have already wound the 600 turn pickup coil whose signal will be captured by AD2 and the Fe sample is mounted on a 4 ohm speaker which will be driven by AD2 at 17Hz. Im just on the lookout for a suitable electromagnet. Earlier I thought of using AD2 to power a small diameter electromagnet, however, the magnetic field produced by it is around 10 Gauss, which is very small. The VSM would need at least 100 Gauss or above, which may be achieved by and external power supply circuitry whose strength can be controlled by some signal from AD2 . Ill be sure to update this post as soon as I get some update Conclusion The Analog Discovery 2 can very well be called as the Swiss Army Knife of Test Equipments. Everything about it is really well documented and there are video tutorials to get you started too, so it's easy to figure out the whole capabilities of the device. The capabilities easily make this the best tool for learning and testing electronics for hobbyists to experienced. Its an extremely versatile tool to have in your lab shelf. However, this is certainly not a high-performance measurement unit, if you need accurate, precise and more control over the data acquisition or for research purpose, the device is not the go-to choice. LabVIEW is no doubt the industry standard for interfacing instruments, however, its Graphical programming ideology sometimes gets messy and daunting to work with.","tags":"Engineering","url":"/analog-discovery-2-labview-home-bundle-review","loc":"/analog-discovery-2-labview-home-bundle-review"},{"title":"Superconductivity","text":"This post is my notes on Superconductivity from video lectures of Sergey Frolov on Solid State Physics and other online sites such as http://www.superconductors.org Properties Discoverd first in Hg at 4.2K in Liquid Helium Current induced in a ring follows $$ I(t)=I_0e&#94;{(-t/\\tau))}$$ and dosent change much for over 100,000 years for SC and goes to 1% of initial value in few nano seconds in a normal metal.

Applications Super conducting single photon detector telescope Quantum computer with photons. Levitating high speed trains(~600 km/h) : Transport vehicles such as trains can be made to \"float\" on strong superconducting magnets, virtually eliminating friction between the train and its tracks.This reduces the heat generated and size occupied as compared to regular electromagnet. A landmark for the commercial use of MAGLEV technology occurred in 1990 when it gained the status of a nationally-funded project in Japan. The Minister of Transport authorised construction of the Yamanashi Maglev Test Line which opened on April 3, 1997. In April 2015, the MLX01 test vehicle attained an incredible speed of 603 kph. MRI : By impinging a strong superconductor-derived magnetic field into the body, hydrogen atoms that exist in the body's water and fat molecules are forced to accept energy from the magnetic field. They then release this energy at a frequency that can be detected and displayed graphically by a computer. NMR , SQUID (Superconducting QUantum Interference Device) : SQUID 's are capable of sensing a change in a magnetic field over a billion times weaker than the force that moves the needle on a compass (compass: 5e-5T, SQUID : e-14T.). With this technology, the body can be probed to certain depths without the need for the strong magnetic fields associated with MRI 's. SQUIDS are being used by the U.S. NAVY to detect mines and submarines. High efficiency generators: Electric generators made with superconducting wire are far more efficient than conventional generators wound with copper wire. In fact, their efficiency is above 99% and their size about half that of conventional generators. Essen, Germany has the world's longest superconducting power cable in production at 1 kilometer. It is a 10 kV liquid nitrogen cooled cable. The cable is smaller than an equivalent 110 kV regular cable and the lower voltage has the additional benefit of smaller transformers. Superfluidity of He Zero viscocity Measurement show the 0 resistance to flow of He ie the flow velocity of liquid helium is independent of applied pressure. in semicunductor attraction between \\(e&#94;-\\) in conduction band and holes in valence bond give rise to a bound pairs known as excitons , they also show super fluidity. Because they contain real bound pairs of 2 fermions (in contrast to cooper pais) excitons are bosons. as a result it is possible for them to form a Bose-Einstein condensate, a superfluid that can flow withoutt resistance (this does not give rise to superconductivity as excitons are incharged Why is there superconductivity? tldr: Two electrons form a bound state called Cooper pair. These cooper pairs form a condensate. When an electron is moving through a solid with momentum K, since it also interacts with the lattice, there is an electron phonon interaction, meaning an electron moving through the crystal launches a phonon, another electron flying in a different direction can absorb this photon and form a bound state. These cooper pairs form a condensate (they are all in the same indistinguishable quantum state). And the condensate can be represented by the wave function \\(\\psi=n_s e&#94;{i \\phi}\\) , where \\(n_s\\) is the density of Cooper pair and \\(\\phi\\) denotes the phase. London equations The London equations, developed by brothers Fritz and Heinz London in 1935 relate current to electromagnetic fields in and around a superconductor. In ohms law \\(j=\\sigma E\\) so its differential wrt time is 0, however 1st london equation gives a non 0 relation with \\(j'\\) and \\(E\\) . In leq1, \\(j\\) is the superconducting current density, E and B are respectively the electric and magnetic fields within the superconductor, \\(q\\) is the charge of an electron & proton, m, is electron mass, and \\(n_s\\) , is a phenomenological constant loosely associated with a number density of superconducting carriers. London eqn 1 (le1) also means that particles in a super conductor accelerate when a voltage is applied, in normal metals they only move with drift velocity and 0 acceleration. taking curl on both side of le1 and using Maxwell equations you get the second form of le1. This when integrated over an area, you get the le2. The rationale for the le1 can be thought of in the following different ways: 1) By definition, the electrons in a superconductor flow with no resistance, hence one can imagine electrons as if they were free electrons und er the influence of a uniform external electric field. According to the Lorentz force law \\(F=eE+ev\\mathrm{x}B\\) these electrons should encounter a uniform force, and thus they should in fact accelerate uniformly. This is precisely what the first London equation states. 2) Current density is defined according to the equation \\(j=-n_s e v\\) , Taking this expression from a classical description to a quantum mechanical one, we must replace values j and v by the expectation values of their operators. The velocity operator \\( v = (p+eA)/m\\) is defined by dividing the gauge-invariant, kinematic momentum operator by the particle mass m . we are using as the electron charge. We may then make this replacement in the equation above. However, an important assumption from the microscopic theory of superconductivity ( BCS ) is that the superconducting state of a system is the ground state, and according to a theorem of Bloch's,[ ] in such a state the canonical momentum p is zero. This gives us \\(j=-\\frac{n_s e&#94;2}{m}\\textbf{A}\\) which is loosely the le1 The solution for that differential equation is \\({ \\nabla &#94;{2}\\mathbf {B} ={\\frac {1}{\\lambda &#94;{2}}}\\mathbf {B} ,\\qquad \\lambda \\equiv {\\sqrt {\\frac {m}{\\mu _{0}n_{s}e&#94;{2}}}}.}\\) Superconductivity in the bulk : Cooper pairs electron-phonon interaction leads to an attraction of electrons Cooper pairs: bound states of two electrons with opposite momentum and spin. size of cooper pair is characterised by coherence length $\\xi = \\frac{\\hbar v_F}{\\pi \\Delta} $ electrons greater than this length cant form pairs the net spin is zero so they obey Bose-Einstein statistics: at low T all pairs condense in the lowest state (no Pauli exclusion !) and hence they are Bosons The gap in the diagram is the Superconducting energy gap, X-axis is the energy, 0 is the fremi level. Here, the size of the energy gap indicates the energy gain for two electrons upon formation of a Cooper pair If a conventional superconducting material is cooled from its metallic state (at higher temperatures) into the superconducting state, then the superconducting energy gap is absent above the critical temperature \\(T_{c}\\) , it starts to open upon entering the superconducting state at \\(T_{c}\\) , and it grows upon further cooling. In the \\Delta$ there are only cooper pair condensate and outside there are only unbound electrons. BCS theory predicts that the size \\(\\Delta\\) of the superconducting energy gap for conventional superconductors at zero temperature scales with their critical temperature \\(\\Delta (T=0)=1.764\\,k_{B}T_{c}\\) . The density of states is \\(N_s(E)=N_N(E) E/(E&#94;2- D&#94;2)&#94;{0.5}\\) The super conducting state can be describes with a singel macroscopic wave function \\(\\Psi=\\sqrt(n_s)e&#94;{i \\phi}\\) with \\(n_s\\) is the density of the cooper pairs, \\(\\phi\\) phase of the condensate. So how does the electron pairing occur? consider the crude model: in the above picture, \\(\\omega_D\\) is the Debye relaxation time Spin singlet nature of cooper pairs were confirmed with NMR measurements Ferromagnetic materials are not super conduction since they cant support pairs of electrons with opposite spins (Explained by BCS ) Superconductor terminology The following content on superconductor terminology is largely derived from http://www.superconductors.org/terms.htm with some modifications. Anneal : To heat and then slowly cool a material to reduce brittleness. Annealing of ceramic superconductors usually follows sintering and is done in an oxygen-rich atmosphere to restore oxygen lost during sintering. The oxygen content of a ceramic superconductor is critical. For example, YBCO with 6.4 atoms of oxygen will not superconduct. But YBCO with 6.5 atoms will. Anti-ferromagnetism: A state of matter where adjacent ions in a material are aligned in opposite or \"anti-parallel\" arrays. Such materials display almost no response to an external magnetic field at low temperatures and only a weak attaction at higher temperatures. There is evidence that anti-ferromagnetism in the copper oxides plays a role in the formation of Cooper pairs and, thus, in facilitating a superconductive state in some compounds. BCS Theory : The first widely-accepted theory to explain superconductivity put forth in 1957 by John Bardeen, Leon Cooper, and John Schreiffer. The theory asserts that, as electrons pass through a crystal lattice, the lattice deforms inward towards the electrons generating sound packets known as \"phonons\". These phonons produce a trough of positive charge in the area of deformation that assists subsequent electrons in passing through the same region in a process known as phonon-mediated coupling. This is analogous to rolling a bowling ball up the middle of a bed. 2 people, one lying on each side of the bed, will tend to roll toward the center of the bed, once the ball has created a depression in the mattress. And, a 2nd bowling ball, placed at the foot of the bed, will now, quite easily, roll toward the middle. Borocarbides : Superconducting borocarbides are compounds containing both boron and carbon in combination with rare-earth and transition elements; some of which exhibit the unusual ability to return to a normal, non-superconductive state at temperatures below Tc. BSCCO : An acronym for a ceramic superconductor system containing the elements Bismuth, Strontium, Calcium, Copper and Oxygen. Typically, a small amount of lead is also included in these compounds to promote the highest possible Tc. BSCCO has probably found the widest acceptance among high-Tc superconductor applications due to its unique properties. BSCCO compounds exhibit both an intrinsic Josephson effect and anisotropic (directional) behavior. Ceramics : Ceramic superconductors are inorganic compounds formed by reacting a metal with oxygen, nitrogen, carbon or silicon. The best-known of these are the copper-perovskites. Ceramics are typically hard, brittle, heat-resistant materials formed by a process known as solid-state reaction. Charge Reservoirs: In superconductors, charge reservoirs are the layers that may control the oxidation state of adjacent superconducting planes (even though they themselves are not superconducting). In the layered cuprates, these consist of copper-oxide chains. if (!document.getElementById('mathjaxscript_pelican_#%@#$@#')) { var align = \"center\", indent = \"0em\", linebreak = \"false\"; if (false) { align = (screen.width < 768) ? \"left\" : align; indent = (screen.width < 768) ? \"0em\" : indent; linebreak = (screen.width < 768) ?

It allows its users to store page content in a git repository along with their code. In this blog post ill walk you through the process of setting up a website by combining Pelican with Github Pages. Pelican is a simple python utility that lets you create beautiful weblogs using just text files. In other words its a static-site generator. I have chosen Pelican over other static-site generators as Pelican unlike its counter parts is based on python hence initial setup takes literally no time. Setting up a github.io page To create your Github user page, log in to Github and create a new repositorie username.github.io, as explained on Github pages. (Use your Github username for these repositories.) The username.github.io repository will contain the output HTML files Pelican generates. To add the output directory as a submodule, initialize it with a README file. Installing Pelican We will first create a virtual environment for Pelican via virtualenv before installing Pelican. virtualenv website cd website source bin/activate You can also do workon website inplace of the last two. Once the virtual environment has been created and activated, Pelican can be installed via prefixing with sudo if permissions warrant: pip install pelican markdown typogrify ghp-import shovel Now clone the source repository you created: git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_USERNAME.github.io.git web-sources Then change directory to the source folder: cd web-sources Because of how Github Pages prefers to work, serving the files from the master branch, you have to put your source code in a new branch, preserving the \"master\" for the output of the static files generated by Pelican. To do that, you must create a new branch called \"source\": git checkout -b source Pelican quickstart Pelican provides an excellent quickstart command. Run it: pelican-quickstart The quickstart will ask you various questions, which you can answer in turn. Before answering them, take a look at my answers below: > Where do you want to create your new web site? [ . ] ./ > What will be the title of this web site?

You might want to open the project folder on your favorite code editor and find the \"content\" folder inside it. Then, create a new file, which can be called my-first-post.md (Just for testing). The contents should begin with the metadata which identifies the Title, Date, Category and more from the post before you start with the content, like this: Title : My first post Date : 2018 - 1 - 2 Modified : 2018 - 1 - 3 Category : misc Tags : first , misc Slug : My - first - post Authors : Your name Summary : What does your post talk about ? Write here . This is the * first post * from my Pelican blog . ** YAY !** Let's see how it looks? Go to the terminal, generate the static files and start the server. To do that, use the following command: (venv)$ make html && make serve While this command is running, you should be able to visit it on your favorite web browser by typing localhost:8000 on the address bar. A little touch up Now, if you want to put an image in a post, a neat way is to first create a ‘images' directory inside your content directory, where your posts are. Now, you have to tell Pelican to use it. Find the pelicanconf.py , the file where you configure the system, and add a variable that contains the directory with your images: STATIC_PATHS = [ 'images' ] Save it. Go to your post and add the image this way: ![Write here a good description for people who can't see the image]({filename}/images/IMAGE_NAME.jpg) You can interrupt the server at anytime pressing CTRL +C on the terminal. But you should start it again and check if the image is correct. Can you remember how? (venv)$ make html && make serve One last step before your coding is \"done\": you should make sure anyone can read your posts using ATOM or RSS feeds. Find the pelicanconf.py, the file where you configure the system, and edit the part about feed generation: FEED_ALL_ATOM = 'feeds/all.atom.xml' FEED_ALL_RSS = 'feeds/all.rss.xml' AUTHOR_FEED_RSS = 'feeds/ %s .rss.xml' RSS_FEED_SUMMARY_ONLY = False Save everything so you can send the code to Github. You can do that by adding all files, committing it with a message (‘first commit') and using git push. You will be asked for your Github login and password. $ git add -A && git commit -a -m 'first commit' && git push --all As I had said before you would be preserving the master branch for the output of the static files generated by Pelican. Now it's time to generate the mater: $ make github You will be asked for your Github login and password again. And… voilà! Your new blog should be live on https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io. What's next? You generated your first Pelican static website using Markdown and Jinja2. Additional modifications can be made to the Jinja2 templates and the content contained in the Markdown files. Adding .gitignore .gitignore file contains a list of files and folder that git will ignore while syncing with the remote repository. Utilizing .gitignore wisely can reduce the amount of data you need to upload. make a file .gitignore in the web-sources file with the following contents #Custom output pelicanconf_local . py #Python * . py [ cod ] # C extensions * . so # Packages * . egg * . egg - info dist build eggs parts bin var sdist develop - eggs . installed . cfg lib lib64 # Installer logs pip - log . txt # Unit test / coverage reports . coverage . tox nosetests . xml # Translations * . mo # Mr Developer . mr . developer . cfg . project . pydevproject Automate GitHub upload process Create a file up.sh in the web-sources git add -A && git commit -a -m '$1' && git push --all Now whenever you want to upload sync the repo just do bash up.sh \"Comment\" Note that the argument \"Comment\" should not contain spaces.

The integer quantization of the Hall conductance was originally predicted by Ando, Matsumoto, and Uemura in 1975, on the basis of an approximate calculation which they themselves did not believe to be true![7] Several researchers subsequently observed the effect in experiments carried out on the inversion layer of MOSFETs. It was only in 1980 that Klaus von Klitzing, working at the high magnetic field laboratory in Grenoble with silicon-based samples developed by Michael Pepper and Gerhard Dorda, made the unexpected discovery that the Hall conductivity was exactly quantized. For this finding, von Klitzing was awarded the 1985 Nobel Prize in Physics. What alerted von Klitzing to the effect was the insensitivity to the fine-tuning of the magnetic field strength. He \"switched on\" the field to apply it to a device through which a fixed current was flowing stabilized by a constant current source, and observed that when things stabilized, a digital voltmeter always showed the same Hall voltage across the sample to many significant figures. (The story is told that he first thought the voltmeter was broken!) Of course, each time the magnetic field was \"turned on\" was different, so the final field would never have been the same on each run of the experiment, and certainly would never have \"accidentally\" taken the precise \"magic value\" of the naive explanation. It is fortunate that von Klitzing switched on the magnetic field with a fixed current through the sample, rather than switched on the current at fixed field, as the coincidence of the unchanged digital voltmeter readings would then never have happened. [4] Theoretical aspects [8,6] The Classical Hall Effect The original, classical Hall effect was discovered in 1879 by Edwin Hall. It is a simple consequence of the motion of charged particles in a magnetic field. The setup for the same is as follows, consider a rectangular bar with thickness, t, Length L, and width W, as shown in Fig 1. Now a constant current along the \\(x\\) axis is passed. When a magnetic field is applied along the \\(z\\) axis ( \\(B_{z}\\) ), the charges in the current experience a force (the Lorentz force). In the absence \\(B_{z}\\) , the charges follow approximately straight paths. However, when \\(B_{z}\\) is applied, their paths get curved, in this way moving charges aggregate on one face of the material. This leaves equal and opposite charges exposed on the other face, where there is a scarcity of mobile charges. The separation of charge establishes an electric field that opposes the migration of further charge, so a steady electric potential is established for as long as the charge is flowing. This is called the Hall voltage \\(V_{H}\\) . The Hall voltage \\(V_{H}\\) can be derived by using the Lorentz force given that, in the steady-state condition, charges are not moving in the y-axis direction. \\(\\vec{{F}}=q(\\vec{E}+\\vec{vx\\vec{B_{z}}})\\) , Now \\(\\vec{F}=0\\implies0=E_{y}-v_{x}B_{z}\\) also \\(E_y=-\\frac{V_H}{w}\\) thus on substituting these values we get : $$\\begin{aligned} V_{H} & = & v_{x}B_{z}w\\end{aligned}$$ This shows that \\(V_{H}\\) is proportional to \\(B_{z}\\) , this result is used in commercial hall sensors which are used to measure magnetic field. However one must note that the result drawn are for the the simple case with no impurities. Otherwise we will have to include the scattering effects. on doing so the previus equation gets modified as $$\\begin{aligned} E_{y} & = & \\frac{-eB\\tau}{m}E_{x}\\end{aligned}$$ where \\(\\tau\\) is called the scattering time. Thus \\(R_{H}\\) called the Hall resistance is defined as $$R_{H}=\\frac{E_{y}}{j_{x}B}=-\\frac{1}{ne}$$ where n is the carrier constant. Thus the measurement of Hall Coefficient gives the following information about the material Carrier concentration , n The sign determines the carriers are holes or electrons. Experimental verification of hall effect.[5] An experiment was performed to measure the charge density of Germanium used as Hall Probe. The experiment was performed under the guidance of Sharvari Kulkarni P. The current passing through sample I, was kept constant at 10mA. The Hall Voltages \\(V_{H}\\) were measured for different values of Magnetic field. For each value of magnetic field, four readings corresponding to different geometric orientations were considered. This is essential due to presence of other thermal and galvanometric transport effects . The data and graphs are as following: Part-1: The value of magnetic field corresponding to particular current was determined and plotted. Two readings corresponding to single current value specifies the values during increment and decrement of current viz. to minimize the error. Part-2: The values of Hall Voltages are measured for different geometrical combinations.The data obtained is as follows - Corresponding graphs are plotted here. From all these graphs, the average value of slope is 0.03218 \\(\\frac{mV}{Gauss}\\) . We have sample current equal to 10mA and sample length as 5mm. Hence the value of Hall Coefficient is 0.1609 \\(\\frac{m&#94;{3}}{C}\\) . Positive sign implies that majority carriers are holes. From this value, the carrier concentration can be calculated as \\(n=3.879x10&#94;{19}m&#94;{-3}\\) Quantum Hall Effects In the previous section we saw details about the Hall effect mainly that Hall Voltage is proportional to the magnetic field. Hall effect is easily observed in room temperature and relatively low magnetic field. If the same setup is now taken down to low temperatures (typically around 1-5 K) and high magnetic field (greater than few Tesla) we see a non linear relation between Hall conductance and Magnetic field. We see some sort of quantization of Hall conductance. The observed resistivity is shown in next figure. [8] On observing the graph and a little bit of theoretical calculations one can deduce the following: Both the Hall resistivity \\(\\rho_{xy}\\) and the longitudinal resistivity \\(\\rho_{xx}\\) exhibit non linear behavior. For lower magnetic field Transverse resistance varies linearly but after certain limit it changes step-like with integer multiples of \\(\\frac{\\hbar}{e&#94;{2}}\\) with some plateau region in between. On these plateau, the resistivity takes the value $$\\rho_{xy}=\\frac{\\hbar}{e&#94;{2}}\\,\\frac{1}{\\nu}\\;\\quad\\nu\\epsilon\\mathbf{Z}$$ The value of \\(\\nu\\) is measured to be an integer to an extraordinary accuracy —- something like one part in \\(10&#94;{9}\\) . The quantity \\(\\frac{\\hbar}{e&#94;{2}}\\) is called the quantum of resistivity (with value 25.8128075 k ) The longitudinal resistance has zero value otherwise except at a point where \\(\\rho_{xy}\\) jumps from one plateau to another. The center of each plateau occurs at a point when magnetic field takes a value $$B=\\frac{hn}{\\gamma e}=\\left(\\frac{n}{\\gamma}\\right)\\phi_{0}$$ Where, n is density of states of electrons and \\(\\phi_{0}=\\frac{\\hbar}{e&#94;{2}}\\) as flux quantum. This is a value of Magnetic field at which number of Landau Levels are filled. In order to see the Quantum Hall effect we need to suppress spin-flip scattering of the conduction electrons. Doing this requires us to do two things. The first one is to apply a magnetic field which is large enough to make the Zeeman energy big enough so that the up-spin and down-spin Landau levels do not overlap. Then we also need to make the temperature low enough so that only one of these spin-split Landau levels has a significant thermal occupation. Because the static magnetic fields that we have available to us in the laboratory are only strong enough to give Zeeman energies of order one degree Kelvin, we need to have temperatures of less than one degree Kelvin in order to see the Quantum Hall effect at all. And the lower we can make the temperature, the better the data will look. Classical Explanation[3] One can explain the above phenomenon classically as follows. Consider the standard 2DEG setup with four probes two along x axis and two along y axis similar to the arrangement in Fig1. Ohm's law can be written as \\(J=\\sigma E\\) .Where \\(\\sigma\\) is conductivity of the material. But in presence of Magnetic field B this \\(\\sigma\\) becomes a 2 x 2 tensor matrix. Hence the corresponding resistivity tensor can be written as $$\\begin{aligned} \\sigma&#94;{-1} & = & \\rho\\end{aligned}$$ $$\\begin{pmatrix}\\sigma_{xx} & \\sigma_{xy}\\\\ -\\sigma_{xy} & \\sigma_{yy} \\end{pmatrix}&#94;{-1}=\\begin{pmatrix}\\rho_{xx} & \\rho_{xy}\\\\ -\\rho_{xy} & \\rho_{yy} \\end{pmatrix}$$ \\(\\therefore\\) $$\\sigma_{xx}=\\frac{\\rho_{xx}}{\\rho_{xx}&#94;{2}+\\rho_{xy}&#94;{2}}\\quad and\\quad\\sigma_{xy}=-\\frac{\\rho_{xxy}}{\\rho_{xx}&#94;{2}+\\rho_{xy}&#94;{2}}$$ This brings up the following cases \\(\\sigma_{xx}=0\\) \\(\\implies\\sigma_{xy}=0\\) so \\(\\sigma_{xx}=\\frac{1}{\\rho_{xx}}\\) this is the general solution \\(\\rho_{xy}\\neq0\\) \\(\\implies\\sigma_{xx}\\) and \\(\\sigma_{xy}\\) are non zero. \\(\\rho_{xx}=0\\implies\\sigma_{xx}=0\\) The third case is the one where we see the transition from one plateau to another plateau. This behavior can be explained with Drude's model of metals which considers metals as free electron gas without any interaction between them.So between two collision electron behaves as a free particle. According to the Drude's Model \\(\\sigma_{xx}=\\frac{\\sigma_{0}}{1+\\left(\\tau\\omega_{c}\\right)&#94;{2}}\\) where \\(\\tau\\) is the relaxation time and \\(\\sigma_{0}=\\frac{ne&#94;{2}\\tau}{m}\\) . Thus \\(\\sigma_{xx}=0\\) implies that \\(\\tau\\rightarrow\\infty\\) or in other words, absence of scattering. In this particular case the current is flowing perpendicular to the field, it has the following form. $$\\hat{E}=\\begin{pmatrix}E_{x}\\\\ E_{y} \\end{pmatrix}=\\begin{pmatrix}0 & \\rho_{xy}\\\\ -\\rho_{xy} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}j_{x}\\\\ j_{y} \\end{pmatrix}=\\begin{pmatrix}\\rho_{xy}j_{y}\\\\ -\\rho_{xy}j_{x} \\end{pmatrix}$$ This shows that E and J are perpendicular. Thus \\(\\hat{E}\\cdot\\hat{J}\\) =0. This means that the work done in accelerating the charges is 0. Thus there is a steady current flowing in the sample. And hence no heat dissipation. Hence, \\(\\sigma_{xx}=0\\) means no current is flowing in longitudinal direction and \\(\\rho_{xx}=0\\) means there is no any dissipation of energy. We also see that $$\\sigma_{xy}==\\frac{-1}{\\rho_{xy}}=\\gamma\\frac{e&#94;{2}}{h}\\qquad\\gamma\\rightarrow integer$$ which is the same as the quantised hall value equation. Landau Levels[2] In presence of magnetic field, electrons follow circular trajectories called cyclotron orbits. The charged particles can only occupy orbits with discrete energy values, called Landau levels. The Landau levels are degenerate, with the number of electrons per level directly proportional to the strength of the applied magnetic field. Landau quantization is directly responsible for oscillations in electronic properties of materials as a function of the applied magnetic field. Now lets look at the mathematical derivation of the above statement. Consider our previous model of two-dimensional electron gas system, say with charge q confined to an area A = \\(L_{x}L_{y}\\) in the x-y plane. Let the magnetic field applied be \\(\\hat{B}=B_{z}\\hat{z}\\) . Now the Hamiltonian of such a system will be given by $$\\hat{H}=\\frac{1}{2m}(\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}-q\\hat{\\mathbf{A}}/c)&#94;{2}$$ where \\(\\hat{p}\\) is the canonical momentum operator and \\(\\hat{A}\\) is the electromagnetic vector potential. There is some gauge freedom in the choice of vector potential for a given magnetic field which means that adding the gradient of a scalar field to \\(\\hat{A}\\) changes the overall phase of the wave function by an amount corresponding to the scalar field. But physical properties are not influenced by the specific choice of gauge. For simplicity in calculation, lets choose the Landau gauge, which is $${\\displaystyle \\hat{\\mathbf{A}}=\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\ B_{z}x\\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}.}$$ $${\\displaystyle \\hat{H}=\\frac{\\hat{p}_{x}&#94;{2}}{2m}+\\frac{1}{2m}\\left(\\hat{p}_{y}-\\frac{qB\\hat{x}}{c}\\right)&#94;{2}}$$ The operator \\(\\hat{p}_{y}\\) commutes with this Hamiltonian, since the operator \\(\\hat{y}\\) is absent by the choice of gauge. Thus the operator \\(\\hat{p}_{y}\\) can be replaced by its eigenvalue \\(k_{y}\\) . The Hamiltonian can also be written more simply by noting that the cyclotron frequency is \\(\\omega_{c}=\\frac{qB}{mc}\\) , giving $$\\hat{H}=\\frac{\\hat{p}_{x}&#94;{2}}{2m}+\\frac{1}{2}m\\omega_{c}&#94;{2}\\left(\\hat{x}-\\frac{\\hbar k_{y}}{m\\omega_{c}}\\right)&#94;{2}$$ . This is the Hamiltonian one would encounter for the quantum harmonic oscillator problem as well, except with the minimum of the potential shifted in coordinate space by $$x_{0}=\\frac{k_{y}}{m\\omega_c}$$ . To find the energies, note that translating the harmonic oscillator potential does not affect the energies. The energies of this system are thus identical to those of the standard quantum harmonic oscillator, $$E_{n}=\\hbar\\omega_{c}\\left(n+\\frac{1}{2}\\right),\\quad n\\geq0$$ . The energy does not depend on the quantum number \\(k_{y}\\) , so there will be degeneracy. With this argument we can conclude that the state of the electron can uniquely determined by two by two quantum numbers, n and \\(k_{y}\\) . Now let us focus on the degeneracy of Landau level. Degeneracy of Landau levels[6,2] Each set of wave functions with the same value of n is called a Landau level. Effects of Landau levels are only observed when the mean thermal energy is smaller than the energy level separation, \\(kT << \\hbar omega_c\\) , meaning low temperatures and strong magnetic fields. Each Landau level is degenerate because of the second quantum number \\(k_{y}\\) , which can take the values \\({\\displaystyle k_{y}={\\frac{2\\pi N}{L_{y}}}}\\) , where N is an integer. The allowed values of N are further restricted by the condition that the center of force of the oscillator, \\(x_{0}\\) , must physically lie within the system, \\(0\\le x0<L_{x}\\) . This gives the following range for N, $${\\displaystyle 0\\leq N<{\\frac{m\\omega_{c}L_{x}L_{y}}{2\\pi\\hbar}}.}$$ For particles with charge \\(q=Ze\\) , the upper bound on N can be simply written as a ratio of fluxes, $${\\displaystyle {\\frac{ZBL_{x}L_{y}}{(hc/e)}}=Z{\\frac{\\Phi}{\\Phi_{0}}},}$$ where \\(\\Phi_{0}=hc/e\\) is the fundamental quantum of flux and \\(\\Phi=BA\\) is the flux through the system (with area \\(A=L_{x}L_{y}\\) ). Thus, for particles with spin S, the maximum number D of particles per Landau level is $${\\displaystyle D=Z(2S+1){\\frac{\\Phi}{\\Phi_{0}}}~}$$ Edge modes[4] So far we have discussed the ideal 2DEG scenario. The real samples, though comparatively clean, do not have the transnational invariance that makes each state in a given Landau level have exactly the same energy. Hence there is some sort of broadening of the Landau level. So what is the explanation in this case ? The initial attempts to explain the effect focused on this effect of disorder, and found that, while two-dimensional electron systems with disorder generally have localized states, this is modified in a magnetic field. Here, the centers of the Landau orbits slowly precess (in opposite senses) around either local minima or local maxima of the potential, corresponding to localized states, but there is an energy at the center of the broadened Landau level at which the centers of the orbits move along open snakelike paths, and the states at that energy are extended as opposed to localized. These edge states act as skipping orbits that precess around the boundary of the system in the opposite sense to that of the Landau orbits, when a particle in a Landau orbit intersects the boundary, and bounces off it.

Web page controlled LED strip using NodeMCU connected on a local network. Outline: Web page controlled LED strip is like the \"Hello world\" of IoT. In this post I will be detailing on the procedure I followed to set it up. The schematic of the project will be as follows: So when we click a button on a web browser we can turn the led strip on or off using a relay which we control using the ESP8266 board. Materials: NodeMCU 5v Relay LED strip LED strip power supply (any generic 12V power supply) Installing NodeMCU Board Package in Arduino IDE : Open up Arduino IDE . Go to Files-> Preferences. Enter http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json into Additional Board Manager URLs field. Now go to Tools->Boards->Board Manager, and search for ESP8266 and install the package. If you have the same board as me (NodeMCU Amica) then you will have to install drivers for CP2102 ( USB to Serial Converter) [Note: some board come with CH340G chip in which case you dont need to follow this step.] Download drivers from here and install it. Connect the nodeMCU to your computer and install the downloaded drives when your system prompts to install the drivers for the newly connected USB device.Go to the device manager of your computer and note down the COM port allocated to the newly connected USB device. Pin Connections: Connect NodeMCU Ground ( GND ) pin to -ve pin of Relay . Connect NodeMCU Supply ( Vin) pin to +ve pin of Relay . Connect NodeMCU Digital pin ( D0 ) to Input pin of Relay . Coding Part The code for the nodeMCU that I have uploaded is here . Replace the line WiFi.softAP(\"Hello_IoT\", \"ashwins12345678\"); with whatever SSID and password you want to put. NOTE. This sketch uses WiFi.softAP instead of the commonly used WiFi.begin, the reason is that when I use WiFi.begin() I can't find the SSID when I do WiFi scan, however, the SSID I do see is of the previous sketch where I used WiFi.softAP(). If you encounter the same problem while using WiFi.begin then using my code should fix it. When u have successfully built your connection and the code, you have to upload the code into the NodeMCU by using a micro USB . Now, go to Tools > Board > ESP8266 Modules and you can see many options for ESP8266 . Select \"NodeMCU 1.0 ( ESP -12E Module). Next, select your port ( the same one you saw in the device manager previously ). If you cant recognize your port, go to the Control Panel > System > Device Manager > Port and update your USB driver. Now upload the code to the board. Finale testing: Now open up your Serial Monitor, and note down the URL . Now put the URL in your phone's browser( it usually defaults to 192.168.4.1). A page will open having two buttons ON and OFF . If everything is correct when you press ON the LED will light up and when you press OFF the LED will turn off. Final Connections: Now that we know our code and setup works let's connect the relay to the led strip power source as shown in the figure in the outline section. Vola! there's our first project! Whats next? We can add more feature to the project such as making it connect to a wifi router so that you can access the LED strip from anywhere in the world. We can convert this project to use the barebone ESP8266 and FTDI programmer. We can use the power supply of the LED strip to power the ESP8266 (Not recommended since most LED power supply have high AC noise as I found out in my case and hence can damage the ESP8266 board).Add more devices for the ESP to control and much much more!
