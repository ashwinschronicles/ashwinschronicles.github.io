<p>The quantum Hall effect is a remarkable phenomenon discovered
experimentally in which the Hall conductivity of a two dimensional
system of electrons is found to have plateaus as a function of variables
which determine the number of electrons participating in the&nbsp;effect.</p>
<p>The integer quantization of the Hall conductance was originally
predicted by Ando, Matsumoto, and Uemura in 1975, on the basis of an
approximate calculation which they themselves did not believe to be&nbsp;true![7]</p>
<p>Several researchers subsequently observed the effect in experiments
carried out on the inversion layer of MOSFETs. It was only in 1980 that
Klaus von Klitzing, working at the high magnetic field laboratory in
Grenoble with silicon-based samples developed by Michael Pepper and
Gerhard Dorda, made the unexpected discovery that the Hall conductivity
was exactly quantized. For this finding, von Klitzing was awarded the
1985 Nobel Prize in&nbsp;Physics.</p>
<p>What alerted von Klitzing to the effect was the insensitivity to the
fine-tuning of the magnetic field strength. He &ldquo;switched on&rdquo; the field
to apply it to a device through which a fixed current was flowing
stabilized by a constant current source, and observed that when things
stabilized, a digital voltmeter always showed the same Hall voltage
across the sample to many significant figures. (The story is told that
he first thought the voltmeter was broken!) Of course, each time the
magnetic field was &ldquo;turned on&rdquo; was different, so the final field would
never have been the same on each run of the experiment, and certainly
would never have &ldquo;accidentally&rdquo; taken the precise &ldquo;magic value&rdquo; of the
naive explanation. It is fortunate that von Klitzing switched on the
magnetic field with a fixed current through the sample, rather than
switched on the current at fixed field, as the coincidence of the
unchanged digital voltmeter readings would then never have happened.&nbsp;[4]</p>

<p>The original, classical Hall effect was discovered in 1879 by Edwin
Hall. It is a simple consequence of the motion of charged particles in a
magnetic&nbsp;field.</p>
<p>The setup for the same is as follows, consider a rectangular bar with
thickness, t, Length L, and width W, as shown in Fig 1.
Now a constant current along the <span class="math">\(x\)</span> axis is passed. When a magnetic
field is applied along the <span class="math">\(z\)</span> axis (<span class="math">\(B_{z}\)</span>), the charges in the
current experience a force (the Lorentz&nbsp;force).</p>
<p><img alt="Fig 1 Schematic diagram of the Hall effect measurement setup" src="../../images/Hall_Effect_Measurement_Setup_for_Electrons.webp"/></p>
<p>In the absence <span class="math">\(B_{z}\)</span>, the charges follow approximately straight paths.
However, when <span class="math">\(B_{z}\)</span> is applied, their paths get curved, in this way
moving charges aggregate on one face of the material. This leaves equal
and opposite charges exposed on the other face, where there is a
scarcity of mobile charges. The separation of charge establishes an
electric field that opposes the migration of further charge, so a steady
electric potential is established for as long as the charge is flowing.
This is called the Hall voltage <span class="math">\(V_{H}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The Hall voltage <span class="math">\(V_{H}\)</span> can be derived by using the Lorentz force given
that, in the steady-state condition, charges are not moving in the
y-axis direction. <span class="math">\(\vec{{F}}=q(\vec{E}+\vec{vx\vec{B_{z}}})\)</span> , Now
<span class="math">\(\vec{F}=0\implies0=E_{y}-v_{x}B_{z}\)</span> also <span class="math">\(E_y=-\frac{V_H}{w}\)</span> thus on
substituting these values we get&nbsp;: </p>
<div class="math">$$\begin{aligned}
V_{H} &amp; = &amp; v_{x}B_{z}w\end{aligned}$$</div>
<p>
This shows that <span class="math">\(V_{H}\)</span> is proportional to <span class="math">\(B_{z}\)</span>, this result is used
in commercial hall sensors which are used to measure magnetic&nbsp;field.</p>
<p>However one must note that the result drawn are for the the simple case
with no impurities. Otherwise we will have to include the scattering
effects. on doing so the previus equation gets modified&nbsp;as </p>
<div class="math">$$\begin{aligned}
E_{y} &amp; = &amp; \frac{-eB\tau}{m}E_{x}\end{aligned}$$</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(\tau\)</span> is called the scattering time. Thus <span class="math">\(R_{H}\)</span> called the Hall
resistance is defined&nbsp;as </p>
<div class="math">$$R_{H}=\frac{E_{y}}{j_{x}B}=-\frac{1}{ne}$$</div>
<p>
where n is the carrier&nbsp;constant.</p>
<p>Thus the measurement of Hall Coefficient gives the following information
about the&nbsp;material</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Carrier concentration ,&nbsp;n</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sign determines the carriers are holes or&nbsp;electrons.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>An experiment was performed to measure the charge density of Germanium
used as Hall Probe. The experiment was performed under the guidance of
Sharvari Kulkarni&nbsp;P.</p>
<p>The current passing through sample I, was kept constant at 10mA. The
Hall Voltages <span class="math">\(V_{H}\)</span> were measured for different values of Magnetic
field. For each value of magnetic field, four readings corresponding to
different geometric orientations were considered. This is essential due
to presence of other thermal and galvanometric transport effects . The
data and graphs are as&nbsp;following:</p>
<p><strong>Part-1:</strong> The value of magnetic field corresponding to particular
current was determined and plotted. Two readings corresponding to single
current value specifies the values during increment and decrement of
current viz. to minimize the&nbsp;error.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="../../images/hall_data_table.webp" style="zoom:67%;"/></p>
<p><img alt="Magnetic field vs Current " src="../../images/hall_data_graph.webp" style="zoom:50%;"/></p>
<p><strong>Part-2:</strong> The values of Hall Voltages are measured for different
geometrical combinations.The data obtained is as follows&nbsp;-</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="../../images/hall_data_table2.webp" style="zoom:67%;"/></p>
<p>Corresponding graphs are plotted&nbsp;here.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="../../images/hall_data_graph2.webp" style="zoom: 67%;"/>

<img alt="image" src="../../images/hall_data_graph4.webp" style="zoom:67%;"/>
<img alt="image" src="../../images/hall_data_graph5.webp" style="zoom:67%;"/></p>
<p>From all these graphs, the average value of slope is <strong>0.03218
<span class="math">\(\frac{mV}{Gauss}\)</span></strong> . We have sample current equal to 10mA and
sample length as&nbsp;5mm.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Hence the value of Hall Coefficient is <strong>0.1609
    <span class="math">\(\frac{m^{3}}{C}\)</span>.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Positive sign implies that majority carriers are&nbsp;holes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From this value, the carrier concentration can be calculated as
    <strong><span class="math">\(n=3.879x10^{19}m^{-3}\)</span></strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="quantum-hall-effects_2">Quantum Hall Effects<a class="headerlink" href="#quantum-hall-effects" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>In the previous section we saw details about the Hall effect mainly that
Hall Voltage is proportional to the magnetic&nbsp;field.</p>
<p>Hall effect is easily observed in room temperature and relatively low
magnetic field. If the same setup is now taken down to low temperatures
(typically around 1-5 K) and high magnetic field (greater than few
Tesla) we see a non linear relation between Hall conductance and
Magnetic field. We see some sort of quantization of Hall conductance.
The observed resistivity is shown in next&nbsp;figure.</p>
<p><img alt="Hall resistance and longitudinal resistivity data as a function of the
magnetic field for a GaAs/AlGaAs hetero-structures at 1.5 K" src="../../images/HallPvsB.webp" style="zoom:50%;"/>[8]</p>
<p>On observing the graph and a little bit of theoretical calculations one
can deduce the&nbsp;following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both the Hall resistivity <span class="math">\(\rho_{xy}\)</span> and the longitudinal
    resistivity <span class="math">\(\rho_{xx}\)</span> exhibit non linear&nbsp;behavior.</li>
</ul>
<p>For lower magnetic field Transverse resistance varies linearly but after
certain limit it changes step-like with integer multiples of
<span class="math">\(\frac{\hbar}{e^{2}}\)</span> with some plateau region in&nbsp;between.</p>
<ul>
<li>On these plateau, the resistivity takes the&nbsp;value</li>
</ul>
<div class="math">$$\rho_{xy}=\frac{\hbar}{e^{2}}\,\frac{1}{\nu}\;\quad\nu\epsilon\mathbf{Z}$$</div>
<p>The value of <span class="math">\(\nu\)</span> is measured to be an integer to an extraordinary
accuracy &mdash;- something like one part in <span class="math">\(10^{9}\)</span>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>The quantity<span class="math">\(\frac{\hbar}{e^{2}}\)</span> is called the quantum of resistivity
(with value 25.8128075 k&nbsp;)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The longitudinal resistance has zero value otherwise except at a
    point where <span class="math">\(\rho_{xy}\)</span> jumps from one plateau to&nbsp;another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The center of each plateau occurs at a point when magnetic field
    takes a value
    <div class="math">$$B=\frac{hn}{\gamma e}=\left(\frac{n}{\gamma}\right)\phi_{0}$$</div>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Where, n is density of states of electrons and
<span class="math">\(\phi_{0}=\frac{\hbar}{e^{2}}\)</span>as flux quantum. This is a value of
Magnetic field at which number of Landau Levels are&nbsp;filled.</p>
<p>In order to see the Quantum Hall effect we need to suppress spin-flip
scattering of the conduction electrons. Doing this requires us to do two
things. The first one is to apply a magnetic field which is large enough
to make the Zeeman energy big enough so that the up-spin and down-spin
Landau levels do not overlap. Then we also need to make the temperature
low enough so that only one of these spin-split Landau levels has a
significant thermal&nbsp;occupation.</p>
<p>Because the static magnetic fields that we have available to us in the
laboratory are only strong enough to give Zeeman energies of order one
degree Kelvin, we need to have temperatures of less than one degree
Kelvin in order to see the Quantum Hall effect at all. And the lower we
can make the temperature, the better the data will&nbsp;look.</p>
<h3 id="classical-explanation3">Classical Explanation[3]<a class="headerlink" href="#classical-explanation3" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>One can explain the above phenomenon classically as&nbsp;follows.</p>
<p>Consider the standard <span class="caps">2DEG</span> setup with four probes two along x axis and
two along y axis similar to the arrangement in Fig1.
Ohm&rsquo;s law can be written as <span class="math">\(J=\sigma E\)</span> .Where <span class="math">\(\sigma\)</span> is conductivity
of the material. But in presence of Magnetic field B this <span class="math">\(\sigma\)</span>
becomes a 2 x 2 tensor matrix. Hence the corresponding resistivity
tensor can be written&nbsp;as</p>
<div class="math">$$\begin{aligned}
\sigma^{-1} &amp; = &amp; \rho\end{aligned}$$</div>
<div class="math">$$\begin{pmatrix}\sigma_{xx} &amp; \sigma_{xy}\\
-\sigma_{xy} &amp; \sigma_{yy}
\end{pmatrix}^{-1}=\begin{pmatrix}\rho_{xx} &amp; \rho_{xy}\\
-\rho_{xy} &amp; \rho_{yy}
\end{pmatrix}$$</div>
<p><span class="math">\(\therefore\)</span>
</p>
<div class="math">$$\sigma_{xx}=\frac{\rho_{xx}}{\rho_{xx}^{2}+\rho_{xy}^{2}}\quad and\quad\sigma_{xy}=-\frac{\rho_{xxy}}{\rho_{xx}^{2}+\rho_{xy}^{2}}$$</div>
<p>This brings up the following&nbsp;cases</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span class="math">\(\sigma_{xx}=0\)</span> <span class="math">\(\implies\sigma_{xy}=0\)</span> so
    <span class="math">\(\sigma_{xx}=\frac{1}{\rho_{xx}}\)</span> this is the general&nbsp;solution</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="math">\(\rho_{xy}\neq0\)</span> <span class="math">\(\implies\sigma_{xx}\)</span>and <span class="math">\(\sigma_{xy}\)</span>are non&nbsp;zero.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="math">\(\rho_{xx}=0\implies\sigma_{xx}=0\)</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The third case is the one where we see the transition from one plateau
to another&nbsp;plateau.</p>
<p>This behavior can be explained with Drude&rsquo;s model of metals which
considers metals as free electron gas without any interaction between
them.So between two collision electron behaves as a free particle.
According to the Drude&rsquo;s Model
<span class="math">\(\sigma_{xx}=\frac{\sigma_{0}}{1+\left(\tau\omega_{c}\right)^{2}}\)</span> where
<span class="math">\(\tau\)</span> is the relaxation time and <span class="math">\(\sigma_{0}=\frac{ne^{2}\tau}{m}\)</span>.
Thus <span class="math">\(\sigma_{xx}=0\)</span> implies that <span class="math">\(\tau\rightarrow\infty\)</span> or in other
words, absence of&nbsp;scattering.</p>
<p>In this particular case the current is flowing perpendicular to the
field, it has the following&nbsp;form.</p>
<div class="math">$$\hat{E}=\begin{pmatrix}E_{x}\\
E_{y}
\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}0 &amp; \rho_{xy}\\
-\rho_{xy} &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}j_{x}\\
j_{y}
\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}\rho_{xy}j_{y}\\
-\rho_{xy}j_{x}

<p> This shows that E and J are perpendicular. Thus
<span class="math">\(\hat{E}\cdot\hat{J}\)</span>=0. This means that the work done in accelerating
the charges is 0. Thus there is a steady current flowing in the sample.
And hence no heat dissipation. Hence, <span class="math">\(\sigma_{xx}=0\)</span> means no current
is flowing in longitudinal direction and <span class="math">\(\rho_{xx}=0\)</span> means there is no
any dissipation of energy. We also see&nbsp;that
</p>
<div class="math">$$\sigma_{xy}==\frac{-1}{\rho_{xy}}=\gamma\frac{e^{2}}{h}\qquad\gamma\rightarrow integer$$</div>

<p>In presence of magnetic field, electrons follow circular trajectories
called cyclotron&nbsp;orbits.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The charged particles can only occupy orbits with discrete energy
    values, called Landau&nbsp;levels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Landau levels are degenerate, with the number of electrons per
    level directly proportional to the strength of the applied magnetic&nbsp;field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Landau quantization is directly responsible for oscillations in
    electronic properties of materials as a function of the applied
    magnetic&nbsp;field.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now lets look at the mathematical derivation of the above statement.
Consider our previous model of two-dimensional electron gas system, say
with charge q confined to an area A = <span class="math">\(L_{x}L_{y}\)</span> in the x-y plane. Let
the magnetic field applied be <span class="math">\(\hat{B}=B_{z}\hat{z}\)</span>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>Now the Hamiltonian of such a system will be given&nbsp;by
</p>
<div class="math">$$\hat{H}=\frac{1}{2m}(\hat{\mathbf{p}}-q\hat{\mathbf{A}}/c)^{2}$$</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(\hat{p}\)</span> is the canonical momentum operator and <span class="math">\(\hat{A}\)</span> is the
electromagnetic vector&nbsp;potential.</p>
<p>There is some gauge freedom in the choice of vector potential for a
given magnetic field which means that adding the gradient of a scalar
field to <span class="math">\(\hat{A}\)</span> changes the overall phase of the wave function by an
amount corresponding to the scalar field. But physical properties are
not influenced by the specific choice of gauge. For simplicity in
calculation, lets choose the Landau gauge, which&nbsp;is</p>
<div class="math">$${\displaystyle \hat{\mathbf{A}}=\begin{pmatrix}0\\
B_{z}x\\
0
\end{pmatrix}.}$$</div>
<div class="math">$${\displaystyle \hat{H}=\frac{\hat{p}_{x}^{2}}{2m}+\frac{1}{2m}\left(\hat{p}_{y}-\frac{qB\hat{x}}{c}\right)^{2}}$$</div>
<p>
The operator <span class="math">\(\hat{p}_{y}\)</span> commutes with this Hamiltonian, since the
operator <span class="math">\(\hat{y}\)</span> is absent by the choice of gauge. Thus the operator
<span class="math">\(\hat{p}_{y}\)</span> can be replaced by its eigenvalue
<span class="math">\(k_{y}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The Hamiltonian can also be written more simply by noting that the
cyclotron frequency is <span class="math">\(\omega_{c}=\frac{qB}{mc}\)</span>,&nbsp;giving</p>
<div class="math">$$\hat{H}=\frac{\hat{p}_{x}^{2}}{2m}+\frac{1}{2}m\omega_{c}^{2}\left(\hat{x}-\frac{\hbar k_{y}}{m\omega_{c}}\right)^{2}$$</div>
<p>
. This is the Hamiltonian one would encounter for the quantum harmonic
oscillator problem as well, except with the minimum of the potential
shifted in coordinate space&nbsp;by </p>
<div class="math">$$x_{0}=\frac{k_{y}}{m\omega_c}$$</div>
<p>.</p>
<p>To find the energies, note that translating the harmonic oscillator
potential does not affect the energies. The energies of this system are
thus identical to those of the standard quantum harmonic&nbsp;oscillator,</p>
<div class="math">$$E_{n}=\hbar\omega_{c}\left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right),\quad n\geq0$$</div>
<p> . The
energy does not depend on the quantum number <span class="math">\(k_{y}\)</span>, so there will be&nbsp;degeneracy.</p>
<p>With this argument we can conclude that the state of the electron can
uniquely determined by two by two quantum numbers, n and <span class="math">\(k_{y}\)</span>. Now
let us focus on the degeneracy of Landau&nbsp;level.</p>
<h3 id="degeneracy-of-landau-levels62">Degeneracy of Landau levels[6,2]<a class="headerlink" href="#degeneracy-of-landau-levels62" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Each set of wave functions with the same value of n is called a Landau
level. Effects of Landau levels are only observed when the mean thermal
energy is smaller than the energy level separation,
<span class="math">\(kT &lt;&lt; \hbar \omega_c\)</span>,
meaning low temperatures and strong magnetic&nbsp;fields.</p>
<p>Each Landau level is degenerate because of the second quantum number
<span class="math">\(k_{y}\)</span>, which can take the values
<span class="math">\({\displaystyle k_{y}={\frac{2\pi N}{L_{y}}}}\)</span>, where N is an&nbsp;integer.</p>
<p>The allowed values of N are further restricted by the condition that the
center of force of the oscillator, <span class="math">\(x_{0}\)</span>, must physically lie within
the system, <span class="math">\(0\le x0&lt;L_{x}\)</span>. This gives the following range for&nbsp;N,
</p>
<div class="math">$${\displaystyle 0\leq N&lt;{\frac{m\omega_{c}L_{x}L_{y}}{2\pi\hbar}}.}$$</div>
<p>For particles with charge <span class="math">\(q=Ze\)</span>, the upper bound on N can be simply
written as a ratio of&nbsp;fluxes,</p>
<div class="math">$${\displaystyle {\frac{ZBL_{x}L_{y}}{(hc/e)}}=Z{\frac{\Phi}{\Phi_{0}}},}$$</div>
<p>
where <span class="math">\(\Phi_{0}=hc/e\)</span> is the fundamental quantum of flux and <span class="math">\(\Phi=BA\)</span>
is the flux through the system (with area <span class="math">\(A=L_{x}L_{y}\)</span>).</p>
<p>Thus, for particles with spin S, the maximum number D of particles per
Landau level&nbsp;is</p>
<div class="math">$${\displaystyle D=Z(2S+1){\frac{\Phi}{\Phi_{0}}}~}$$</div>
<h3 id="edge-modes4">Edge modes[4]<a class="headerlink" href="#edge-modes4" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>So far we have discussed the ideal <span class="caps">2DEG</span> scenario. The real samples,
though comparatively clean, do not have the transnational invariance
that makes each state in a given Landau level have exactly the same
energy. Hence there is some sort of broadening of the Landau level. So
what is the explanation in this case&nbsp;?</p>
<p>The initial attempts to explain the effect focused on this effect of
disorder, and found that, while two-dimensional electron systems with
disorder generally have localized states, this is modified in a magnetic
field. Here, the centers of the Landau orbits slowly precess (in
opposite senses) around either local minima or local maxima of the
potential, corresponding to localized states, but there is an energy at
the center of the broadened Landau level at which the centers of the
orbits move along open snakelike paths, and the states at that energy
are extended as opposed to localized. These edge states act as skipping
orbits that precess around the boundary of the system in the opposite
sense to that of the Landau orbits, when a particle in a Landau orbit
intersects the boundary, and bounces off&nbsp;it.</p>
