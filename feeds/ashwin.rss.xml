&lt;p&gt;Github, worlds leading  hosting service for Git repositories  offers a simple, elegant website solution. It allows its users to  store page content in a git repository along with their code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this blog post ill walk you through the process of setting up a website by combining Pelican with Github Pages. Pelican is a simple python utility that lets you create beautiful weblogs using just text files. In other words its a static-site generator. I have chosen Pelican over other static-site generators as Pelican unlike its counter parts is based on python hence initial  setup takes literally no time.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Ashwin</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:None,2019-01-01:/gh-pages-with-pelican.html</guid><category>Github</category><category>Pelican</category><category>gh-pages</category></item><item><title>The Journey Begins</title><link>/the-journey-begins.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks for joining me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am Ashwin Kumar K, a Dual Degree BE â€“ Int. MSc Physics at BITS Pilani KK Birla Goa campus (Batch of 2017).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first post of this site where I intend to post some of my works related to the field of Science and Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had always wanted to publish some of my projects and experiments on a public platform so that people working on similar projects can give and take ideas. It also serves as a way to showcase the experience that I have gained while doing such projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I intend to post details of projects or experiments that I have performed mostly in the field of Science and Engineering as I complete them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a trip down my memory lane. I hope to see you around!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Ashwin</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:None,2018-06-18:/the-journey-begins.html</guid><category>Random</category></item></channel></rss>
